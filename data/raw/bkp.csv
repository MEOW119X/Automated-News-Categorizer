The court ordered the three to cease such action.', ""After the ruling, Mr Noppadol's group said in the letter, Amnesty National Thailand announced a campaign to send a million letters to people and organisations all over the world, calling for them to demand the government cease legal action against Ms Panusya."", ""This could be taken as\xa0interference in the internal affairs of the kingdom, and Amnesty International Thailand's action was tantamount to urging people to commit aggression towards the royal institution, the letter said."", 'For these reasons, the government should immediately take action to remove this organisation from Thailand, the group wrote.The letter said at 10am on Nov 25, members of the group would rally in front of Government House and deliver speeches denouncing\xa0Amnesty International Thailand.']",https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/politics/2220255/pro-monarchy-group-to-rally-against-amnesty-nov-25
