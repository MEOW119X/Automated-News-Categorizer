Pol Col Sippanan Sornkhunkaew, commander of 23rd Border Patrol Police Unit, said the action was a joint operation by local government agencies in the province. The pickup, a black Nissan Navara with roofed-over rear section, was intercepted shortly after it left a petrol station in the munipal area of Na Kae district about 1am. A search found 12 sacks in the back holding 500 slabs of compressed marijuana, each  weighing 1kg. The driver, Saravut Butngam, 28, of Surin's Chom Phra district, was arrested. Mr Saravut, an unemployed construction worker, said he received a telephone call from a man who promised to pay him 50,000 baht to drive the pickup from a petrol station in Nakhon Phanom's Na Kae district to a spot in Sakon Nakhon. At Sakon Nakhon, another driver would take over. Pol Col Sippanan said the marijuana was probably smuggled across the Mekong river from Laos and was destined for the South, from where it would be smuggled to a third country."

No new deaths were reported, leaving the toll at 83. The Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) said the new cases included 36 found during active testing and 28 from hospital reports. The country also imported 16 cases, it added. Pathum Thani logged the most cases from active testing campaign -- 35 cases – while one was found in Nonthaburi. For the first time since active testing began during the second wave of the novel coronavirus outbreak, original epicentre Samut Sakhon was not on the list. However, the coastal province next to the capital still led the number of cases found in hospitals – 19 -- followed by Tak (3), Bangkok (2), Nakhon Pathom (2), Chonburi (1) and Ratchaburi (1) The Imported cases arrived from Nigeria, the United Kingdom, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland, South Africa and the United States. Vaccinations begin Thailand has received 110,000 doses of the Sinovac formula and started vaccinations on Sunday. The vaccine has been distributed to 13 provinces with Bangkok receiving 33,600 doses, followed by Samut Sakhon with 15,000 doses. CCSA spokesman Taweesilp Visanuyothin said Phuket and Koh Samui will receive the vaccine by Monday. On Sunday, 319 health personnel and officials in Nakhon Pathom, Nonthaburi, Samut Sakhon and Samut Prakan were injected with the vaccine. Dr Taweesilp said there were no side effects reported. Although the vaccine has arrived, the CCSA spokesman cautioned against complacency as it will not be available to the public until later this year. According to Bloomberg's vaccine tracker, 241 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have already been administered in 103 countries. In the United States, more than a fifth of the population have received at least one shot, and almost a third in the United Kingdom."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:44,General,BMA to give Green Bridge a revamp,"Buoyed by the warm public response for Bangkok's first skypark across the Chao Phraya River that opened last year, the city's administration is planning to develop a similar elevated park in Bangkok's central business district. The project -- dubbed ""Bangkok Green Bridge"" -- is a planned redevelopment of a two-decade old, 1.3-kilometre bridge between Sarasin intersection near Lumphini Park and Benjakitti Park in Khlong Toei district, which currently serves as a pedestrian walkway and bicycle lane. ""The governor has wanted to pursue the Bangkok Green Bridge since 2019 as part of the area's green development masterplan, but it was postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic,"" said deputy Bangkok governor Sakchai Boonma said. ""Now, we are going ahead with the project."" The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) has already earmarked 260 million baht to reinforce the bridge's structure and other landscaping works. According to City Hall, the bridge's design will be finalised in April. The park is the joint effort of the Urban Design and Development Centre-Centre of Excellence in Urban Strategies (UDDC-CEUS), Atom Design, Landscape Collaboration, Studio Taila and Lighting Research and Innovation Centre (LRIC) at King Mongkut's University of Technology, Thonburi. BMA said construction is expected to begin soon and could be completed as early as the end of this year. Mr Sakchai said the BMA wanted to redevelop the 1.3-km elevated walkway as a gift for city dwellers. First built over two decades ago during the tenure of Bhichit Rattakul as Bangkok governor, the walkway's central location should have made it a hit among locals. However, only those living in nearby communities, in addition to joggers and cyclists who regularly exercise at the two parks which the walkway connects, know about its existence. Worse still, the walkway is now known as a crime-prone area, due to its isolation. Its supporting structures have become dilapidated, as in the past two decades, the BMA has only given it two minor facelifts. ""The [Bangkok Green Bridge] project will give a new lease of life to the bridge,"" Taiwut Khankaew, the director of BMA's Public Works Department, told the Bangkok Post. Under the plan, the walkway will be expanded by 300 metres, while certain parts of the bridge will be widened from 3m to 7.5m to fit a pedestrian path, cycling lanes and public green spaces. The director of UDDC-CEUS, Asst Prof Niramon Serisakul, said the design team has been working since 2019 to gather public opinion from nearby communities to ensure the park's design reflects residents' demands. ""This way, residents will have a sense of ownership and help take care of it,"" she said. ""We want it to be a learning centre about urban animals and plants."""
1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,General,Anutin among first to get Covid shot,"Priority groups in 18 provinces will receive the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine today, according to the Department of Disease Control (DDC). They are Samut Sakhon, Bangkok, Samut Prakan, Samut Songkhram, Nonthaburi, Nakhon Pathom, Pathum Thani, Tak, Ratchaburi, Chon Buri, Phuket, Koh Samui district of Surat Thani, Chiang Mai, Rayong, Chanthaburi, Trat, Phetchaburi and Krabi. According to the ministry's plan, priority groups in the major centres of Chiang Mai and Bangkok will be inoculated today while those in Mae Sot in Tak, Phuket and Koh Samui will receive the first of their two vaccine shots tomorrow. Speaking to media yesterday, DDC director-general Opas Karnkawinpong said that a total of 110,000 doses of the Sinovac formula had been distributed to the 11 provinces -- Nonthaburi, Samut Sakhon, Chon Buri, Samut Prakan, Pathum Thani, Bangkok, Tak's Mae Sot district, Nakhon Pathom, Samut Songkhram, Ratchaburi and Chiang Mai. Another 800,000 doses will arrive this month and will also be reserved for those most in need, Dr Opas said. The DDC chief said Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul was among the first 95 people to receive the vaccine at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute and another 159 doses were also administered at Samut Sakhon Hospital yesterday. No severe side-effects have been reported, Dr Opas said, before adding this initial round was intended to boost public confidence in the vaccine's safety. Mr Anutin became the first person in the country to get his shot at the hospital at 7.30am yesterday with Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha in attendance. The vaccine is a formula developed by Sinovac Life Sciences, which has been judged safe for people aged 18-59. So, while no doubt safe for those outside that age range too, Mr Anutin said doctors advised the 66-year-old Gen Prayut not to be the first recipient. Mr Anutin also said the AstraZeneca vaccine, which arrived on Feb 24, had yet to be endorsed by the Medical Science Department. ""AstraZeneca has yet to submit documents and samples,"" he said. ""The company is processing paperwork and has informed the government that it will submit the documents in about 10 days. ""When everything is ready, the prime minister will then receive the vaccine."" Following Mr Anutin, others vaccinated yesterday included Deputy Public Health Minister Sathit Pitutecha, Culture Minister Itthiphol Kunplome, Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Chalermchai Sri-on, Deputy Education Minister Kanokwan Vilawan and permanent secretary for public health Dr Kiatiphum Wongrajit. A number of executives at the Public Health Ministry also received the jab with their second shots to follow on March 22."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,General,Factory faces closure after withholding Covid details,"The Pathum Thani Covid-19 Control Centre has found a factory in the province concealing information about Covid-19 infected workers. Dr Rangsan Butcha, director of Prachathipat Hospital in Thanyaburi district, made the disclosure yesterday after a meeting of the provincial Covid-19 committee. He did not give the name of the factory. He said the centre would propose state agencies have the factory temporarily closed. The owner was uncooperative and concealed information about its migrant workers, he said. He said the provincial centre ran active search cases in this factory last week and found 26 of 60 migrant workers tested positive for the coronavirus. Speaking on the overall situation in Pathum Thani, Dr Rangsan said the province anticipated Covid-19 would be brought under control within one month from now. In another development, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) will hand out 12,000 baht in financial help to officials and staff during the Covid-19 pandemic. Bangkok governor Aswin Kwan‑ muang approved a 1.02 billion baht budget for providing financial handouts to employees, according to an official at the BMA. BMA officials and employees are each entitled to receive a 12,000 baht handout. Last year, BMA did not pay any awards or bonus to staff, which was against the normal practice. Usually, the BMA earmarks about 1 billion baht annually for bonuses and special financial help. The BMA last year made less revenue from tax than normal and decided to postpone further tax collections to ease the economic burden on city residents who have also been hit by the pandemic. City Hall also focused its budget spending last year on fighting Covid rather than helping staff. This source said the handout followed a recommendation from the State Audit Office that required the BMA to follow other local administrations in providing help. The source said BMA's committee appraising and awarding personnel also followed Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha's policy that ordered government agencies to reserve a budget for additional payments to public officials that may be affected by the pandemic."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,General,Elephants fail to halt rise of Thong Thin Thai,"Jaruk Srion, MP from the Palang Thong Thin Thai Party, is spearheading a campaign to prevent wild elephants from foraging for food in villagers' plantations in Chanthaburi, proposing a ""Chanthaburi model"" to tackle the problem. The long-standing problem of elephants raiding plantations in Chanthaburi has been a challenge for the MP since he took office over a year ago. The conflict between humans and elephants is a terrible blow to local fruit farmers in this eastern province -- some of them saw their crops disappear overnight after wild elephant ravaged their land. ""There are around 120 wild elephants in Chanthaburi. Three districts -- Khaeng Hang Maeo, Khao Kitchakut and Soi Dao -- are battling with the elephants raiding plantations,"" Mr Jaruk said. ""The elephants come down from the mountains and eat fruit along with the plants that take five years to bear it."" The main solution used by Chanthaburi to tackle this problem is to construct fences and moats to separate forests from villagers' plantations. However, elephants still manage to invade farms as soon as this infrastructure falls into disrepair. Five-metre-wide moats were constructed along a 150-200 kilometre boundary, from Wongkot Mountain to Soi Dao district. Excavated earth from the moats was used for the construction of roads alongside the moats, he said. ""Roads were constructed in parallel with the moats to facilitate inspection and maintenance of the moats and fences. If they are always in good conditions, they can definitely prevent elephants from invading farms,"" the MP said. Another solution that has been adopted to keep the pachyderms at bay is the use of natural corridors to guide them to three or four local reservoirs without passing through plantations. ""In the future, an elephant watchtower will be constructed there to help promote tourism in the province. We call all of these efforts to prevent wild elephants the ""Chanthaburi Model"" which I believe will be 100% effective,'' Mr Jaruk told Bangkok Post. ""With support from an ad hoc committee tackling the problem of foraging elephants, I believe that the model will be very much effective in preventing wild elephants from invading plantations, although it could take two years to be effective. Other provinces can then adopt this model to tackle the same problem."" On the political front, before the Future Forward Party (FFP) was dissolved, Mr Jaruk was one of the four FFP MPs who were about to be expelled from the party at that time for voting in favour of an emergency decree to transfer some army forces and budget to King's Guard command. Rumour has it that he would move to many other political parties before he joined the Thai Local Power Party, known in Thai as Palang Thong Thin Thai Party, which is led by Siam Rath newspaper owner and business tycoon Chatchawal Kong-udom. ""My political principle is to work for people on all issues -- big or small. One of the big issues that I am working on right now is housing for the poor. My team and I plan to repair old houses or construct new ones for them every month with our MP salaries and budget from the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security. ""As for other groups of people across the country, I also serve them as deputy chairman of a House committee on corruption prevention and suppression. People who are in conflict with government officers, taken advantage of or prosecuted unfairly can come to me for help. ""In the next general election, my party will field candidates in all three constituencies of Chanthaburi. As the party's deputy leader, I was assigned by the party leader to be in charge of the eastern region. We aim to win at least two constituencies. ""My son will help with the party's campaign in the 3rd constituency and I will be in charge of the 1st and 2nd constituencies. We try not to be overconfident, but we can feel that the people of Chanthaburi like us because we pay attention to the small details when it comes to serving them,'' he said. Despite being a coalition MP, Mr Jaruk admitted that he thought a weakness of this administration was the justice system. ""Democracy is a gradual process. It's not a full-fledged democracy yet [in Thailand]. There are a lot of Thai people who don't play by the rules. I suggest that those who lose keep working, doing good things for people to gain their trust and we will compete again in the next election,'' he said. On the next cabinet reshuffle, the deputy party leader said he thinks it's time for his party leader to have a ministerial post in the cabinet. Mr Jaruk said the party had discussed the cabinet reshuffle and mentioned the fact that the party had around 20 MPs in hand. ""We want to create unity in our party for the stability of the administration,"" he said. The 57-year-old MP graduated with a Master in Public Administration from Thongsook College in Bangkok. The veteran politician was with the Pheu Thai Party before switching to the now-dissolved Future Forward Party and the Thai Local Power Party."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,General,Down but not out,"Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD) par­ty, and tarnished de­mo­cracy heroine of that country, hit the headlines on Feb 1 when she was arrested and deposed by the Myanmar military, aka Tatmadaw, in its coup. Ms Suu Kyi along with other members of her party was accused of taking part in the Nov 2020 general election ""fraud"". Myanmar police have pressed several charges against her following the coup led by armed forces chief Min Aung Hlaing, including breaching import and export laws, and possession of unlawful communication devices. She has been detained since but her whereabouts are still unclear. Reports say she is being held at her residence in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw. Pro-democracy groups, her supporters in Myanmar and the United Nations Security Council have called for her release, pledging ""continued support"" for Myanmar's democratic transition. Ms Suu Kyi, the elected civilian leader who served as Myanmar's State Counsellor, a role akin to a prime minister or head of government, led her NLD party to win a landslide victory in the 2015 elections. However she was barred from becoming the president due to a clause in Myanmar's charter saying that anyone who married a foreign national can not become the president. She was widely seen as a de facto leader. In 2016, Ms Suu Kyi met migrant workers in Samut Sakhon for an official visit after she took on the job. She spoke to a crowd of a few hundred migrant workers, urging improved relations with Thai authorities and the Myanmar embassy. ""Burmese people have to live in Thailand as guests, and as such, the hosts will respect the guests. The Myanmar embassy must help Burmese workers in Thailand,'' she said. Ms Suu Kyi received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 while still under house arrest. She gave up her freedom to challenge the army generals who ruled Myanmar for decades. When she was Myanmar's State Counsellor, she faced a barrage of criticism over Myanmar's treatment of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state. In 2017, critics called for Suu Kyi's Nobel prize to be revoked, citing her silence over the persecution of Rohingya people in Myanmar. However the Nobel prize panel said the prize was awarded for her past achievements in fighting for democracy and freedom up until 1991. So the rules regulating the Nobel prizes did not allow for a prize to be withdrawn. However, she is not out of the woods yet. The International Court of Justice is mulling a case brought by Gambia against her as then leader of the country. She also faces ongoing condemnation from human rights defenders and Western countries, saying she has never brought up the issue of Rohingya for talks at an international level, and turns a blind eye to their plight. Ms Suu Kyi, the youngest of Gen Aung San's children, has served as leader of the NLD party since 2011, having been general-secretary from 1988 to 2011. She played a key role in Myanmar's transition from the military junta to partial democracy in the 2010s. Ms Suu Kyi, who has demonstrated courage in promoting democracy and peaceful political reform in Myanmar, was born in Yangon. Her father died when she was two, after which she left for India and England to study. She was married to Michael Aris, a British scholar, with two children. She returned to Myanmar and took part in the 8888 Uprising of Aug 8, 1988 and became NLD general-secretary, which she had formed with the help of several retired army officials who criticised the junta. In the 1990 elections, the NLD won 81% of the seats in parliament, but the results were nullified, as the military government refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. Ms Suu Kyi was detained before the elections and remained under house arrest for almost 15 of the 21 years from 1989 to 2010, becoming one of the world's most prominent political prisoners. Her party boycotted the 2010 elections, resulting in a decisive victory for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party. Her party won the elections in 2015 and 2020."

Din Daeng police chief Pol Col Ratthachai Sriwichai said on Monday that investigators were compiling evidence, including fingerprints found in the compound, to register complaints against the invaders. A group of protesters walked to the police station after the rally outside the 1st Infantry Regiment ended, arriving about 2am. Damage included a police pickup truck set on fire, a police motorcycle damaged and a window broken, Pol Col Ratthachai said. During the rally outside the infantry barracks, which started on Sunday afternoon and continued until about 1am,  23 police and 10 demontrators were injured.

Sunday night 's rally, organised by Restart Democracy (Redem) on Vibhavadi-Rangsit Road, was called off shortly after midnight. Redem is the lastest recarnation of the Free Youth group. The Erawan Medical Centre on Monday reported that 23 police and 10 protesters were treated for injuries received during the clashes. One police officer on duty died of a heart attack. He was Pol Capt Wiwat Sinprasert, of Thammasala police station, who had heart disease. Pol Maj Gen Piya Tawichai, the Metropolitan Police Bureau deputy chief, said 22 demonstrators were arrested and were being detained at the Region 1 office of the Border Patrol Police Bureau in Khlong Luang district of Pathum Thani. Charges to be pressed against them included violation of the emergency decree on Covid-19 prevention, and damaging public property, he said. Police fired rubber bullets, water cannon and tear gas at the protesters as they pushed through a barrier of empty shipping containers and tried to move closer to the barracks, where  Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha lives in an army welfare house. Police have been criticised for again using violent measures against the protesters. Pol Maj Gen Piya on Sunday night defended their actions, saying the protest had become violent and government property was being vandalised. Gen Prayut offered condolences on the death of the police officer, in a statement issued from Government House, and called for police on duty to show patience and for protesters to respect the law."

1-มี.ค.-21,6:30,Politics,Anucha tipped to lead DES Ministry,"Prime Minister's Office Minister Anucha Nakasai is tipped to become the Digital Economy and Society (DES) Minister, replacing Buddhipongse Punnakanta who lost his position after he was convicted and jailed last week, sources in the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) said. The sources said PPRP leader and deputy prime minister Prawit Wongsuwon met party executives last Thursday to discuss who would fill the vacancy. Mr Anucha was nominated for the post as he had played a key role in the government's economic affairs team. As such, he is expected to be put in charge of efforts to steer the economy through digital projects such as the Rao Chana (""We Win"") aid scheme, the sources added. Mr Buddhipongse was one of the eight former leaders of the now-disbanded People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) who were jailed by the Criminal Court on Wednesday last week. They were granted temporary release by the Appeal Court two days later as they prepared to fight their convictions. Two other cabinet ministers were convicted along with Mr Buddhipongse and lost their posts as a result, namely Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan and Deputy Transport Minister Thaworn Senneam. In total, 26 people were sentenced last week for their roles in the protests which culminated in the May 2014 coup that removed Yingluck Shinawatra and her administration from power. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Democrat Party leader Jurin Laksanawisit  declined to confirm a report that said ministerial posts would be swapped among coalition parties in the next cabinet reshuffle. ''I have never heard of it,'' he said, adding that party secretary-general Chalermchai Sri-on is responsible for coordinating with coalition partners. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has not yet told the party to submit a list of party candidates for the ministerial posts to him, Mr Jurin said. Deputy Prime Minister and Bhumjaithai Party leader Anutin Charnvirakul  brushed aside reports that the party would be given additional cabinet posts in the next reshuffle. ''It all boils down to the spirit of teamwork,'' he said. When asked to comment on the issue of PPRP MPs abstaining instead of backing Transport Minister Saksayam Chidchob, secretary-general of Bhumjaithai, in the no-confidence vote on Feb 20, Mr Anutin said the two parties were discussing the matter."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,Politics,House hack shows need for upgrade,"Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha is said to be at loggerheads with Prawit Wongsuwon, his deputy PM and leader of the ruling Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP), over the imminent cabinet reshuffle. A source has told the BangkokPost that Gen Prayut wants to bring in professional experts but Gen Prawit is hoping to hand the coveted posts to members of his party. A cabinet shake-up appears inevitable after three ministers were jailed on Wednesday and lost their posts as a result. The next day, Gen Prayut was asked if only the three posts left vacant by the prison sentences would be affected. He replied that the immediate focus would be on the vacant posts and only later would he decide if any further changes were also necessary. The three ministerial posts that must be filled are digital economy and society (DES), education and deputy transport -- DES Minister Buddhipongse Punnakanta, Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan and Deputy Transport Minister Thaworn Senneam were found guilty by the Criminal Court of charges linked to street protests to oust the Yingluck Shinawatra administration. Among outsiders being eyed by the prime minister is one of his advisers, Pirapan Saliratha-vibhaga, who is tipped to land the post of education minister, the source said. However, this prompted a group of 90 PPRP MPs to sign a petition declaring their support for Gen Prawit to decide which members of the party should be nominated for the cabinet posts, the source said. Wirach Ratanasate, chief government whip and a PPRP list-MP, confirmed that the 90 MPs wanted Gen Prawit to act decisively after news emerged of outsiders being approached to join the cabinet. Mr Wirach said Gen Prawit had not known about that but played down the reports. ""When he [Gen Prawit] learned about it, he told party members to calm down and said the party's executives would hold a meeting next week,"" Mr Wirach said. The meeting, set for Tuesday, is certain to discuss the imminent reshuffle. Wanwichit Boonprong, a political science lecturer at Rangsit University, said the primary goal of the next reshuffle could be to build bridges between the PM and PPRP ministers left unhappy with their current posts as a result of the previous reshuffle. Mr Wanwichit said Capt Thamanat Prompow, a Deputy Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister, could receive a ministerial post because criticism of him in the past had decreased drastically and he had since worked harder to work closely with colleagues. He also said the reshuffle could become a peace offering to the Bhumjaithai Party to maintain unity among coalition partners after six MPs in the PPRP abstained instead of backing Transport Minister Saksayam Chidchob, secretary-general of the Bhumjaithai Party, in the crucial no-confidence vote on Feb 20."
1-มี.ค.-21,20:32,Politics,"Rubber bullets, tear gas fired as rally turns violent","A rally by pro-democracy protesters outside the 1st Infantry Regiment in Bangkok turned violent on Sunday as police fired rubber bullets, water cannon and tear gas at demonstrators trying to approach the barracks. Demonstrators held up shell casings to show that rubber bullets had been fired at them.  There were no initial reports of injuries, but an ambulance was seen driving towards Veterans General Hospital. Riot police decided to use water cannon to break up the rally after some demonstrators removed shipping containers laid out to keep them away from the barracks on Vibhavadi Rangsit Road. They also fired tear gas at the protesters, who hurled bottles and other objects back at them. Objects could be seen flying from both sides. After a brief but violent clash, the demonstrators moved back to the area outside Veterans General Hospital near the barracks. The standoff between police and the protesters continued outside the hospital but tensions eased when security guards formed a human chain to keep protesters and police at a safe distance from one another. Some demonstrators vowed to advance towards the residence of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha inside the barracks, but were dissuaded by others. ""Do not throw anything at police,"" protest leaders said repeatedly through megaphones, before both sides said they would ""move one step backward"". Earlier on Sunday, protesters gathered at Victory Monument before marching to the barracks. A sizeable contingent of Myanmar nationals also joined the rally, voicing support for democracy on a day that saw six protesters killed after opposing the Feb 1 coup in the neighbouring country.  Metropolitan Police Bureau (MPB) deputy chief Pol Maj Gen Piya Tawichai warned Myanmar protesters that they could face deportation. The rally forced the temporary closure of the tollway exit in Din Daeng and traffic police advised motorists avoid driving to the area. MPB commissioner Pol Lt Gen Pakkapong Pongpetra tried to negotiate with protest leaders to ease tension. "
1-มี.ค.-21,16:13,Politics,Containers piled outside barracks to block protesters,"Police have piled shipping containers outside the 1st Infantry Regiment in Bangkok to block pro-democracy protesters from approaching the barracks on Sunday in their latest rally against Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha. The containers were laid out on the inside traffic lanes of Vibhavadi Rangsit Road where it passes the military compound ahead of a protest march from Victory Monument. The demonstrators, led by the Free Youth group, are targeting the prime minister's residence inside the barracks to air their discontent over double standards in the judiciary system after four leading activists were denied bail by the Court of Appeal on Saturday. Protest leaders cried foul after seeing protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban and seven other key members of the People's Democratic Reform Committee -- the group that organised sometimes violent demonstrations that helped overthrow the elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014 -- walk out of Bangkok Remand Prison on bail on Friday after they were sentenced on multiple charges, including terrorism and insurrection. Four protest leaders -- Parit Chiwarak, Anon Nampa, Somyot Pruksakasemsuk and Patiwat Saraiyaem -- have been detained since Feb 9 on lese majeste and other charges. The Metropolitan Police Bureau (MPB) had earlier planned to deploy only 600 personnel at the rally, but that number has since swelled to about 2,000. MPB deputy commissioner Tawichai said on Sunday police decided to install containers to prevent the marchers from entering the army camp, which is a unit of the King's Guard, and to fend off possible violence. The containers are blocking traffic on the inside lanes of the road and Pol Maj Gen Piya said the protesters would not be allowed to occupy other lanes open to traffic. Protesters started converging at Victory Monument before marching to the barracks, which is about three kilometres away."

Deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Bureau (MPB) Pol Maj Gen Piya Tawichai had assessed the rally in terms of expected turnout and the risk of third parties instigating violence. He said the MPB has prepared four companies of police officers to maintain order. Pol Maj Gen Piya said police had not yet decided whether to use containers to block the road leading to the 1st Infantry Regiment barracks as they did during previous rallies, adding that barriers would be used only if necessary to avoid any significant impact on commuters. ""I am concerned over possible violence during the protest as explosives were used [in past demonstrations],"" he said. Messages from the Free Youth group invited people to join the rally seemed to suggest an incident might happen, he added. Meanwhile, Noraset Nanongtoom, a lawyer from the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights group, yesterday tweeted on the Appeal Court's ruling dismissing an appeal for the temporarily release of pro-democracy protest leaders including Parit Chiwarak, Arnon Nampa, Somyot Pruksakasemsuk and Patiwat ""Mor Lam Bank"" Saraiyaem. The four have been detained since Feb 9 on lese majeste and other charges relating to anti-government demonstrations. They were denied bail three times earlier. Mr Noraset said the application submitted to the court on Friday outlined four points that he believed supported the release of the four. The first was a cash bond of 400,000 baht for each defendant, which was more than the previous bail request. Charnvit Kasetsiri, a former rector of Thammasat University, and Panas Tassaneeyanon, a former dean of the university's Faculty of Law, had agreed to act as guarantors for the defendants, he said. He said the defendants also posed no flight risk, had not yet found been guilty and all had permanent residences. Prajak Kongkirati, an academic who supports the Ratsadorn group, also tweeted on the court's ruling. The academic compared the four to the eight former leaders of the disbanded People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) who were granted bail on Friday on charges relating to the street protests which ousted the Yingluck Shinawatra administration. He used a Thai hashtag that means equal bail. On Friday, Mr Noraset, acting as legal counsel of the Ratsadorn group, filed an appeal for the release of the four protest leaders after the court temporarily released eight former PDRC leaders on bail of 800,000 baht each. The eight were jailed on Wednesday by the Criminal Court, but walked out of Bangkok Remand Prison on Friday afternoon after the Appeal Court granted them bail."
1-มี.ค.-21,5:00,Politics,MPs deny pushing for reshuffle sway,"Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon on Saturday insisted the prime minister has confirmed to him that no outsiders will be brought in at the next cabinet reshuffle. The deputy premier dismissed claims that Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) MPs had signed a petition urging Gen Prawit to leverage his favourable ties with Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha ahead of the expected rejig. Gen Prayut has insisted he will wait for the PPRP and the coalition to agree on nominations for the vacant positions before he decides, the deputy premier said yesterday. A cabinet shake-up appears inevitable after three ministers were jailed on Wednesday and lost their posts as a result. The vacant positions that must be filled are minister for digital, economy and society (DES), minister for education and deputy transport minister. DES Minister Buddhipongse Punnakanta, Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan and Deputy Transport Minister Thaworn Senneam were found guilty by the Criminal Court of charges linked to street protests to oust the Yingluck Shinawatra government. Deputy Minister of Agricultural and Cooperatives Thamanat Prompow, who is also a deputy leader of the PPRP, has denied reports that he too is spearheading his own push to influence selections. Spokesman of the coalition Democrat Party Rames Rattanachaweng said the cabinet reshuffle was up to the premier and his party had not discussed the matter as members had been preoccupied with the Nakhon Si Thammarat by-election. They were, however, expecting a discussion on the matter. Meanwhile, the committee of relatives of the Black May '92 heroes yesterday arranged agreed to censure the government outside parliament during a forum held at the Thai Journalists Association. Chairman of the Campaign for Popular Democracy Phichai Ratanatilaka Na Bhuket, who spoke at the event, said Gen Prayut lacked the ability to forge national reconciliation -- one of the promises he made when he seized power. Thai politics since Gen Prayut came to power had become less democratic and freedom of expression had been limited, he said. Secretary-General of the People Network Against Corruption, Veera Somkwamkid, talked about the so-called ""elephant tickets"" that were allegedly used to buy promotion for police officials, promising legal against the PM if no action was taken."

A source has told the BangkokPost that Gen Prayut wants to bring in professional experts but Gen Prawit is hoping to hand the coveted posts to members of his party. A cabinet shake-up appears inevitable after three ministers were jailed on Wednesday and lost their posts as a result. The next day, Gen Prayut was asked if only the three posts left vacant by the prison sentences would be affected. He replied that the immediate focus would be on the vacant posts and only later would he decide if any further changes were also necessary. The three ministerial posts that must be filled are digital economy and society (DES), education and deputy transport -- DES Minister Buddhipongse Punnakanta, Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan and Deputy Transport Minister Thaworn Senneam were found guilty by the Criminal Court of charges linked to street protests to oust the Yingluck Shinawatra administration. Among outsiders being eyed by the prime minister is one of his advisers, Pirapan Saliratha-vibhaga, who is tipped to land the post of education minister, the source said. However, this prompted a group of 90 PPRP MPs to sign a petition declaring their support for Gen Prawit to decide which members of the party should be nominated for the cabinet posts, the source said. Wirach Ratanasate, chief government whip and a PPRP list-MP, confirmed that the 90 MPs wanted Gen Prawit to act decisively after news emerged of outsiders being approached to join the cabinet. Mr Wirach said Gen Prawit had not known about that but played down the reports. ""When he [Gen Prawit] learned about it, he told party members to calm down and said the party's executives would hold a meeting next week,"" Mr Wirach said. The meeting, set for Tuesday, is certain to discuss the imminent reshuffle.

1-มี.ค.-21,23:45,World,World's first Covax jab injected as US eyes J&J rollout,"ACCRA: Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo on Monday became the first recipient of a coronavirus vaccine under the global Covax scheme, as US health workers prepared to distribute nearly four million doses of the single-shot Johnson & Johnson jab. Covax, a scheme designed to ensure that poorer countries do not miss out on Covid-19 vaccines that have so far been largely hoovered up by rich nations, is aiming to deliver at least two billion doses by the end of the year. Akufo-Addo received his AstraZeneca shot live on television along with his wife, a day before the rest of the first batch of 600,000 Covax doses are deployed across Ghana. ""It is important that I set the example that this vaccine is safe by being the first to have it, so that everybody in Ghana can feel comfortable about taking this vaccine,"" the president said. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi also got his coronavirus jab on Monday -- although a glitch in the online booking system meant thousands of others were turned away from hospitals nationwide. And in the United States, 3.9 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are due to be delivered after it became the latest jab to get the green light from US regulators. The J&J rollout comes as a boost to President Joe Biden's plan to beat back a virus that has killed more than half a million Americans, making the US the world's worst-hit nation. Vaccines are seen as crucial to returning the world to normality and healing the economy after a pandemic that has claimed more than 2.5 million lives across the globe. More than 224 million vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, according to national data compiled by AFP, with the Philippines among the latest countries to launch a rollout Monday. But rich countries have bought up the vast majority of those available, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to warn that the crisis cannot end unless poor countries can vaccinate their populations too. A new row is brewing over a call, led by India and South Africa, for intellectual property rights to the vaccines to be waived. Backed by dozens of governments from Argentina to Bangladesh, they argue that this would boost production and ultimately bring the pandemic to a swifter end. But the United States, the European Union and Switzerland -- home to major pharmaceutical firms -- oppose the idea, which is being thrashed out at a World Trade Organization meeting on Monday and Tuesday. Some countries are now cautiously lifting strict curbs on daily life as infection rates stabilise, with Germans rushing to hairdressers Monday as salons reopened. ""It's such a relief. I couldn't bear to look at myself in the mirror before!"" Hans-Joachim Berthold, a 64-year-old Berliner, told AFP after his first cut in two and a half months. But while inoculation campaigns are now well under way, the spread of highly infectious Covid variants has fuelled worries that they could prove more resistant to the vaccines. Britain has appealed for a person infected with the potent Brazilian strain to come forward after the person failed to leave contact details while being tested -- meaning they could still be infecting others without knowing it. In some countries, widespread vaccine scepticism remains another obstacle to achieving mass immunity, although a survey of six countries suggests willingness to get the jab is on the rise. Even in France, the country with the least enthusiasm of those surveyed, willingness is up to 59 percent, the study by KekstCNC found. In the entertainment world, mass vaccinations are fuelling hopes of an eventual return to live events with big crowds. The Berlin film festival kicked off online Monday, but organisers are hoping to stage a gala awards ceremony in June if pandemic conditions permit. At the usually-glitzy Golden Globes on Sunday night, awkward technical glitches interspersed the dishing out of awards to those behind some of the past year's best film and television. The night's first winner, ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" supporting actor Daniel Kaluuya, initially lost sound for his acceptance speech, forcing an apology from presenter Laura Dern."

Royal officials said the Duke of Edinburgh, as he is formally known, was taken from King Edward VII's hospital to the state-run St Bartholomew's Hospital in the City of London. Doctors there ""will continue to treat him for an infection, as well as undertake testing and observation for a pre-existing heart condition"", they added. ""The Duke remains comfortable and is responding to treatment but is expected to remain in hospital until at least the end of the week."" Philip was admitted to King Edward VII's hospital on February 16 as a ""precautionary measure"" and on the advice of his doctor, after feeling unwell. But the palace was quick to point out that his admission was not related to Covid-19, and later said he was being treated for an undisclosed infection. He and the queen, 94, both had the first dose of a Covid vaccination on January 9 because of their age, which puts them in one of the most vulnerable categories. An ambulance was seen leaving the King Edward VII's hospital late morning on Monday, driving off past banks of photographers and camera crews. But a police van -- and tinted windows in the ambulance -- blocked sight of who was inside the vehicle, which left from a rear entrance. Umbrellas were also held up to conceal the gap between the ambulance and the hospital doors. - Blocked artery Philip turns 100 on June 10 and his already lengthy stay in hospital has raised concerns because of his age, even though he was said to have been comfortable and responding to treatment. His youngest son, Prince Edward, said last week his father was feeling ""a lot better"" and was looking forward to returning home. He thanked members of the public for sending messages of support. Last Monday, Philip's grandson, Prince William, said the duke was ""OK and being closely monitored by medical staff. Two days earlier, William's father and Philip's eldest son, heir-to-throne Prince Charles, visited him in hospital but made no comment afterwards. Philip was able to walk into the hospital unaided when he first was first admitted and arrived using private transport, rather than an ambulance, a source said at the time. The former naval officer was treated at the same hospital in August 2012 after a recurrence of a bladder infection that laid him low during the queen's diamond jubilee celebrations. The previous year, he had a stent fitted after suffering a blocked coronary artery. St Bartholomew's Hospital, near St Paul's Cathedral, is internationally renowned and a centre of excellence for cardiac and cancer care. Barts Heart Centre is Europe's largest specialised cardiovascular service, according to the hospital's website."
1-มี.ค.-21,20:45,World,French ex-president Sarkozy convicted for corruption,"PARIS: Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy was found guilty of corruption on Monday and handed a three-year prison sentence after a court in Paris convicted him for trying to illegally influence a judge during his time in office. The sentence includes two years suspended, which means it is unlikely Sarkozy will physically go to prison. He is almost certain to appeal and remains free, with no arrest warrant issued. The verdict is the latest twist in the tumultuous political career of the 66-year-old who ruled France from 2007 to 2012 and remains a favourite for many on the right. The conviction is likely to undermine any attempted comeback to frontline politics, an ambition he has denied, but which has been promoted by many supporters ahead of 2022 presidential elections. Only one other French president, Sarkozy's political mentor Jacques Chirac, was put on trial after leaving office, but he was excused from having to attend his 2011 corruption trial because of ill health. Chirac received a two-year suspended sentence over the creation of ghost jobs at the Paris city hall to fund his party when he was mayor. The verdict on Monday related to a case of influence peddling and corruption, one of at least four separate investigations into the former leader, who married former supermodel and singer Carla Bruni while in office. 'Not the slightest act' Sarkozy was accused of offering to help a judge obtain a senior job in Monaco in exchange for putting pressure on an inquiry into his campaign finances. The former president told the court during the trial he had ""never committed the slightest act of corruption"". Prosecutors called for him to be jailed for four years and serve a minimum of two, and asked for the same punishment for his co-defendants -- lawyer Thierry Herzog and the judge Gilbert Azibert. ""The events would not have occurred if a former president, as well as a lawyer, had kept in mind the magnitude, the responsibility, and the duties of his office,"" prosecutor Jean-Luc Blachon told the court as the trial wound up in December. The graft and influence-peddling charges -- among several legal cases against him -- carry a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of one million euros ($1.2 million). 'With certainty' Prosecutors say Sarkozy and Herzog tried to bribe judge Azibert over an inquiry into claims the former leader had received illicit payments from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt during his successful 2007 presidential campaign. The state's case is based on wiretaps of conversations between Herzog and Sarkozy, with prosecutors accusing him of ""using secret telephone lines"" to cover up his attempt to infiltrate the court. Prosecutor Celine Guillet said it had been established ""with certainty"" that judge Azibert transmitted confidential information about the Bettencourt case to his friend Herzog. One conversation ""overwhelmingly"" showed that Sarkozy had promised to intervene to get Azibert a post in Monaco, she said. Sarkozy's lawyer Jacqueline Laffont lashed out at the flaws and ""emptiness"" of the prosecutor's accusations, with the defence also claiming that the tapped conversations had been just ""chats between friends"". Azibert, who was a senior adviser at France's highest appeals court at the time, never got the job in Monaco. Sarkozy's lawyers argued this pointed to the absence of corruption, but prosecutors said French law makes no distinction between a successful corruption attempt and a failed one. More to come Sarkozy was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing in the Bettencourt affair but still faces a raft of other legal woes. On March 17 he is scheduled to face a second trial over accusations of fraudulently overspending in his failed 2012 reelection bid. He has also been charged over allegations he received millions of euros from Libyan dictator Moamer Kadhafi for his 2007 election campaign. And in January, prosecutors opened another probe into alleged influence-peddling by Sarkozy over his advisory activities in Russia. Sarkozy's long-running legal travails helped sink his comeback bid for the 2017 presidential vote, but he has surfed on a wave of popularity since announcing his retirement from politics in 2018. Lines of fans queued over last summer to have him sign his latest memoir, ""The Time of Storms"", which topped best-seller lists for weeks."

Gunmen from cattle rustling and kidnapping-for-ransom gangs on Friday invaded the Government Girls Secondary School in remote Jangebe village, whisking the girls away from their hostel. It is Nigeria's third school attack in less than three months -- a series that has revived traumatic memories of the ""Chibok girls"" kidnapped by jihadists nearly seven years ago. Since the incident, government officials have been in talks with the kidnappers, known locally as bandits, over the girls' release, two sources told AFP. Both sources asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. ""Talks are ongoing with the bandits holding the girls and we hope to make a breakthrough soon,"" said a government official privy to the negotiations. ""It is a delicate situation which requires patience and tact as it involves the lives of hundreds of girls."" A second source said the location of the girls had been established but a military option was not on the cards, to avoid ""putting the lives of the hostages in danger."" Recently, some bandits renounced violence and accepted the state government's amnesty offer in exchange for laying down their arms. A source said ""repentant bandits"" were being contacted to reach out to their former comrades as part of efforts to free the students. ""The negotiations have gone far, with a few hurdles on the way, and once such hurdles are surmounted the girls will be released. That's our ardent hope,"" the source added. On Sunday, a delegation from the Nigerian central government met with Zamfara state governor Bello Matawalle, giving an assurance from President Muhammadu Buhari that the girls would be reunited with their families. Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika said all that mattered was the ""safe return of these children"" and there was no need for ""blame games."" Northwestern and central Nigeria have seen a surge in attacks by heavily armed criminal gangs raiding villages, killing and abducting residents after looting and torching homes. On Saturday, 42 people -- 27 schoolboys, three teachers and 12 family members abducted by gunmen in Kagara in central Niger state -- were released after spending 10 days in captivity."
1-มี.ค.-21,18:49,World,"France, Germany struggle to sell AstraZeneca vaccine safety","Already facing a daunting Covid vaccination challenge, French and German authorities are fighting to convince more people that a jab from the pharma giant AstraZeneca is just as effective as others. Stocks of the vaccines from the British-Swedish firm are going unused in both countries, depriving officials of a crucial tool to help end a pandemic that has been a social and economic calamity on a scale not seen since World War II. Only 273,000 AstraZeneca doses have been administered in France out of 1.7 million received as of end-February, according to health ministry figures. The poor take-up comes even as the target group for the jabs, health workers over 50 and people with other serious health risks, can get the vaccine directly from their doctor instead of waiting for appointments at vaccination centres. But both France and Germany refused to authorise the vaccine for people over 65, fanning fears over its effectiveness compared to the two others approved for Europe, from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Jacques Battistoni, head of the MG France doctors' union, last week denounced the widespread ""AstraZeneca bashing"" that was causing many vials to go unused. Health Minister Olivier Veran, himself a doctor, tried to dispel the doubts by getting the vaccine live on TV. And the country's vaccination coordinator, Alain Fischer, complained last week that the ""bad press"" surrounding the shot was ""deeply unfair"". But so far France is not allowing more segments of the population to get the vaccine, nor allowing it for the elderly despite such approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Even President Emmanuel Macron didn't do any favours when he described the AstraZeneca jab as ""quasi-ineffective for people over 65"" — just hours before the EMA gave its green light. Mr Macron will make Monday his first visit to a Covid vaccination centre, in the Paris suburb of Bobigny. 'Every day counts' In Germany as well, calls are growing to relax the vaccination priority list to make sure no AstraZeneca shots go to waste. By Feb 23, 1.45 million doses had been delivered to Germany, of which only 240,000 had been injected. The controversy has contributed to the government's decision to move teachers and childcare workers from priority group three to group two. But some regional leaders are urging Germany to go further still, with Bavarian prime minister Markus Soeder on Sunday saying ""not a single AstraZeneca dose should be left over or thrown out"". ""Before that happens: vaccinate anyone who wants it,"" he told the Bild am Sonntag daily. ""Every day counts."" The leader of Baden-Wuerttemberg state, Winfried Kretschmann, said Germany could not afford to have vaccines going unused because some of those entitled to it are snubbing it. ""In that case, we should loosen our strict regulations and vaccinate people even if it's not their turn yet under the priority guidelines,"" Mr Kretschmann told the Welt am Sonntag daily. Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany's 16 regional leaders are meeting on Wednesday to discuss the next steps in the fight against the pandemic. Mrs Merkel herself praised the AstraZeneca shot as ""a vaccine that can be trusted"" in an interview last week and pleaded with Germans not to pick and choose their vaccines. When asked if she would lead by example and take the AstraZeneca vaccine, Merkel replied that she was not eligible for this particular jab given that she was 66 years old. The question is sure to re-emerge however if Germany's vaccine commission does decide to recommend the jab for those aged 65 and over. The STIKO commission ""will very soon publish a new updated recommendation"" after a study showed it to be effective for the elderly, its head Thomas Mertens said last Friday. "

Richer countries have surged ahead with inoculating their population, but many poorer countries are still awaiting their first vaccine doses. ""It is important that I set the example that this vaccine is safe by being the first to have it, so that everybody in Ghana can feel comfortable about taking this vaccine,"" the 76-year old president said before receiving a shot of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in a live broadcast. The first lady Rebecca Akufo-Addo also received a shot, one day before the rest of the 600,000 doses are deployed across the country. Ghana's food and drug authority last month authorised the Indian-made vaccine and Russia's Sputnik V, as the government aims to target 20 of its 30 million population by year's end. Last Wednesday, Ghana was the first country to receive vaccines from Covax, led by Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Some 145 participating economies are set to receive 337.2 million doses by mid-year -- enough to vaccinate a little over 3% of their combined populations. Covax has said it hopes to raise the figure to up to 27% in lower-income countries by the end of December. Ghana has recorded 84,023 Covid-19 cases and 607 deaths since the start of the pandemic, although the true figure is believed to be higher because of lack of testing. Schools reopened in January after a 10-month closure, but large social gatherings are banned and land and sea borders have remained closed since March 2020. Despite the vaccine roll-out, the president said that all the current restrictions to curb the spread of the virus were to remain in place."

The programme aims to inoculate around 5,000 workers in hospitality and ride-sharing services by the end of this month. The campaign was rolled out at Nusa Dua Bali Convention Center in Bali's capital Denpasar, set up in partnership with Southeast Asian ride-hailing giant Grab. ""This drive-thru programme is good, because for us drivers who work on the street every day, we are very vulnerable to being exposed to the virus,"" a ride-hailing driver Zul Widodo told AFP. In August, Bali closed the door to foreign tourists over coronavirus concerns, battering its key tourism sector. ""The Covid-19 vaccine is paramount for Indonesia's tourism industry recovery,"" Tourism Minister Sandiaga Uno said in a weekend statement. ""The availability of vaccines continues to be a source of hope for people to return to normalcy and boost confidence that they can travel safely."" The island has recorded some 923 deaths and just over 34,000 virus cases. The drive-thru vaccination has been rolled out alongside Indonesia's nationwide vaccination bid, which kicked off in January with the Chinese CoronaVac jabs. Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, plans to innoculate more than 180 million of its nearly 270 million people. But it was not clear if the drive-thru programme would be rolled out in other cities across the archipelago. Indonesia's economy -- Southeast Asia's largest -- has lurched into recession during a pandemic that has infected more than 1.3 million people and killed over 36,000 nationwide, according to official data, though low testing rates mean the figures could be much higher."

Prime Minister Hun Sen said in a speech posted on his Facebook page on Sunday that he will likely be vaccinated on Thursday at Calmette Hospital, the Khmer Times reported. On Tuesday, Minister of Health Mam Bun Heng will be joined by WHO representative Dr Li Ailan and Unicef representative Foroogh Foyouzat at the airport to receive the Astra Zeneca vaccines. The doses are being provided courtesy of the Covax Facility, a global vaccine alliance aimed at providing equal access to Covid-19 vaccines to countries across the world. Cambodia is due to receive at least 1,296,000 vaccines in total, with the rest of the vaccines arriving throughout this year, according to the Covax Facility’s latest interim distribution forecast report. During his speech, the prime minister said this shipment of vaccines was a result of fruitful cooperation with Cambodia’s multilateral partners, including the United Nations and especially the WHO and Unicef. To date, Ghana and the Ivory Coast are the only two countries to receive shipments of Covid-19 vaccines through the Covax Facility. The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines arriving Tuesday are manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII). They are one of two vaccines that have earned Emergency Use Listing (EUL) status from the WHO, along with the Pfizer vaccine. Besides the almost 1.3 million doses due to arrive from the Covax Facility, Cambodia has been negotiating with the Indian government to purchase another five million of the same AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines. Cambodia will now have two vaccines to offer its citizens: the Sinopharm vaccine and the AstraZeneca vaccine. One of the biggest differences between the two is that those older than 59 are encouraged to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, whereas the Sinopharm vaccine is recommended for people aged 18-59. Breastfeeding women are also able to be vaccinated with AstraZeneca “if they are part of a group prioritised for vaccination,” the WHO said in a Feb 11 press release. Like the Sinopharm vaccine, it requires two doses to be fully effective. To date, over 60,000 people in Cambodia have received the Sinopharm vaccine, including almost 47,000 military officials and close to 13,500 civilians. According to the WHO, the efficacy rate for the AstraZeneca vaccine is 63.09%. Sinopharm has claimed its efficacy rate is 72.5%. Priority groups in Cambodia have so far been identified as politicians, armed forces, journalists and health officials. The first batch of 600,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine donated by China was split in half, with 300,000 being stored by the Ministry of Defence to be used on armed forces, dignitaries, senior ministers, governors, secretaries and undersecretaries of state. The other 300,000 were given to the Ministry of Health to be used by health officials and journalists. It is unclear at this point how the newest batch of vaccines to arrive in Cambodia will be distributed."

""A special Asean foreign ministers meeting will be convened via video conference tomorrow and where we will listen to the representative of the Myanmar military authorities,"" Vivian Balakrishnan said in parliament on Monday. He also called on the Myanmar military authorities to desist from the use of lethal force, ""and to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation to prevent further bloodshed, violence and deaths."" On Monday, protesters in Myanmar marched in defiance of a crackdown by security forces that killed at least 18 people the previous day. He also urged all parties in Myanmar to engage in discussions to find long-term political solutions, including a way to return to the path of democratic transition. ""We believe this can only begin if President Win Myint, State Counsellor and Foreign Minister Aung San Suu Kyi, and the other political detainees are immediately released,"" he told parliament. A Myanmar court has filed two more charges against Suu Kyi, according to a lawyer acting for her. Last week, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi met Myanmar’s military-appointed foreign minister, Wunna Maung Lwin, and Thai counterpart, Don Pramudwinai, for talks in Bangkok. The initial efforts led by Indonesia to resolve the crisis have raised suspicion among Myanmar democracy activists who fear dealing with the junta would confer legitimacy on it and its bid to scrap the November election that Suu Kyi won. "

Harry and his wife Meghan Markle rocked Britain's monarchy with their shock announcement in January 2020 that they were stepping back from royal duties. CBS on Sunday released brief clips of an ""intimate"" interview with Winfrey about their lives which will air March 7. ""My biggest concern was history repeating itself,"" Harry, 36, said, apparently referring to the death of his mother who was killed in a high-speed car crash in Paris in 1997 as she tried to escape paparazzi. Harry has long had a difficult relationship with Britain's tabloids and blames press intrusion for contributing to Diana's death. ""I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here talking to you with my wife by my side,"" Harry, holding Markle's hand, told Winfrey. ""Because I can't begin to imagine what it must have been like for her (Diana), going through this process by herself all those years ago. ""It's been unbelievably tough for the two of us, but at least we have each other."" The couple, who announced on Valentine's Day that they were expecting a second child, have launched several legal cases against British news outlets alleging invasion of privacy -- including one that ended last month with a victory against Associated Newspapers. In a rare interview, Harry last week revealed that he left royal life because the British press was ""destroying"" his mental health. ""We all know what the British press can be like, and it was destroying my mental health,"" he told ""The Late Late Show"" host James Corden. ""I was, like, this is toxic. So I did what any husband and what any father would do. I need to get my family out of here,"" said Harry, who relocated to the United States with Markle last year. Harry also said he was more comfortable with the portrayal of the royal family in the hit Netflix series ""The Crown"" than he was with newspaper stories written about him and his family. In February, Buckingham Palace announced that the couple had permanently quit royal duties following a one-year review of the new arrangement. Queen Elizabeth II ordered the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as they are formally known, to relinquish their honorary titles and patronages."
1-มี.ค.-21,19:02,Business,Union slams Thai Airways move to slash leave days,"The labour union of Thai Airways International is protesting changes to the ailing flag carrier's employment contract, which its employees were asked to agree to as part of its financial rehabilitation programme. The contract, the union's representatives said, is unfair to THAI employees as it entitles them to fewer leave days and shorter holidays, so a formal complaint has been filed with the Department of Labour Protection and Welfare. As part of THAI's attempt to reduce operating costs as it undergoes debt rehabilitation supervised by the Central Bankruptcy Court, the airline rolled out an early retirement programme for its executives. Last month, the flag carrier said it had cut some 240 positions from its 21,000-strong workforce. The airline's rehab scheme — which includes the plan to offer new employment contracts to staff who continue to work with the company — is set to be presented to the CBC later on Tuesday. An adviser to THAI's labour union, Nares Puengyam, said those who elect to remain and/or were asked to stay in their positions will be asked to forfeit the contracts they signed before the company went into debt rehab. However, the new contract trims the number of public holidays the staff are entitled to receive and substantially slashes leave days.  For example, those employed for 20-30 years will see their public holidays reduced from 17 days a year under the old contracts to 13 days. Their leave days will also be cut from 24 days a year to just six.  The company argued that the old contracts were governed by the State Enterprise Relations Act (2000) and since THAI is no longer a state enterprise, the act is no longer binding on the airline.  THAI lost its status as a state-owned enterprise last year when the Finance Ministry reduced its stake in the airline to under 50% to facilitate the rehab process. Mr Nares stressed that under the Labour Protection Act (1998), a company must hold talks with its employees before changing the terms of employment.  He urged the department to investigate whether any employees had been coerced into signing the new contract. The union adviser said he has been informed by a source that some employees had been warned their careers might be in jeopardy if they refuse to accept the new contract. ""We want everyone in the company to move to a new phase in an amicable and truly consenting manner,"" he said.  Mr Nares said the department has invited the company and the union to discuss a solution on March 11.  The CBC approved THAI's recovery plan in the middle of last year after the coronavirus pandemic grounded most of its fleet, adding to its woes. The airline is in debt to the tune of 332 billion baht, according to figures posted on the Stock Exchange of Thailand website."

Actual investment in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) could be at least 300 billion baht this year, up from 96 billion baht in 2020, or 46% of total project applications, EEC head Kanit Sangsubhan told a briefing. ""As investors didn't invest last year, they would have to do it this year. There will be a bunch of projects held up from previous years,"" he said. The EEC straddles eastern provinces and is a centrepiece of government efforts to boost growth and encourage investment particularly in high-tech industries. Investors are allowed to rent land for up to 99 years.  In a separate briefing, Stanley Kang, chairman of the Joint Foreign Chambers of Commerce in Thailand, said the country remained a good investment destination but it needed to reopen as soon as possible to draw foreign investors. ""If travelling is difficult, it will be hard to help the economy,"" he said. ""But vaccines have arrived and we hope Thailand will produce vaccines in June, so the second half should be better,"" he added. On Sunday, the country started its Covid-19 inoculation campaign, but it has yet to lift a travel ban imposed last April to curb the spread of the virus. Thailand's tourism-reliant economy, Southeast Asia's second largest, suffered its deepest slump in over two decades last year due to the impact of the pandemic. The government expects growth of 2.5-3.5% this year. For most of last year the country kept infections low, but a second wave emerged in December and slowed activity. Recent cases, however, have slowed sharply. "
1-มี.ค.-21,17:39,Business,Thai Airways seeks B50bn infusion under debt revamp,"Thai Airways International Plc is seeking a capital infusion of as much as 50 billion baht under a debt restructuring plan set to be submitted to the Central Bankruptcy Court to keep the flag carrier operational, according to people familiar with the matter. The fund may be raised through equity, loans or convertible securities, said the people, who asked to not be identified before the debt plan is submitted to the court on Tuesday. The capital infusion plan will need to be backed by the airline’s hundreds of credit-holders and approved by the court, they said. Under the debt rehabilitation plan discussed by the court-appointed planners, banks and bondholders will have to take minimum haircut on their exposure, the people said. A spokesman for THAI declined to comment on the specifics of the debt rehabilitation plan but said the carrier’s acting president Chansin Treenuchagron will hold a briefing at 2pm time on Tuesday. THAI, which posted a record loss of 141 billion baht last year, is seeking to reduce its liabilities from 336.7 billion baht and return to profit once the Covid-19 pandemic ends. The airline has sold stakes in some units, cut staff and opened its flight simulators to the public to generate additional revenue and cushion the blow from an unprecedented hit to the global tourism and travel industry. The court had in September approved THAI’s request to appoint EY Corporate Advisory Services  and the carrier’s board members as debt revamp planners. Largest shareholder The Ministry of Finance, the largest shareholder of THAI, will look at the restructuring plan in detail once it’s submitted to the court to see if it’s in line with government rules and can support it, the State Enterprise Policy Office said. The office will also consult the Public Debt Management Office before advising the government on its stance, it said. The airline’s losses last year included one-time expenses of almost 92 billion baht from an employee separation plan and impairment losses on aircraft, right-of-use assets and aircraft spare parts, it said last week. The widening losses sent THAI equity to a negative 127 billion baht at the end of last year, it said. Its shares, up 29% this year, were suspended last week as the Stock Exchange of Thailand considered whether the company is subject to delisting because of its equity turning negative. The bourse will decide on delisting by Sunday."

The market was bustling before dawn, crowded with traders, buyers and migrant workers. They must all strictly follow measures imposed to prevent the spread of the virus. Trucks delivering seafood to the market, and the vehicles of sellers and buyers, must all go through screening points. The temperatures of all occupants are checked and they must  show proof they have been tested for Covid-19. The exception is members of the market. The have been issued papers by the market administration certifying they have been through health screening. All migrant workers at all fish and shrimp piers must wear face masks and protective gear such as gloves, rubber boots and rubber aprons, in line with the standards set by the Public Health Ministry. Buyers or farmers who bring shrimp and fish from their farms to the market are each given a queue card and must wait in an area where seats are arranged in rows divided by plastic partitions, in line with the social distancing rule. Seafood is sorted by workers on raised platforms, for proper hygiene. Traders and owners of fish and shrimp stalls all expressed their delight the market had finally reopened after being closed for over 10 weeks. They gave asurances they would strictly follow all anti-Covid-19 measures and hoped Samut Sakhon's economy would soon recover. The provincial public health office reported that as of midnight on Sunday there were 19 new infections, all detected in hospitals - 12 Thais and seven foreigners. The province's accumulated Covid-19 cases rose to 16,377, of whom 16,115 had recovered and 255 were still under treatment. The provincial death toll from Covid-19 remains at seven. Active case finding has involved 201,361 people being tested to date in the province."
1-มี.ค.-21,12:30,Business,Can Myanmar be saved?,"After a month under military rule, Myanmar remains gripped by anger and frustration. Despite the growing danger to their personal safety, thousands of people continue to hit the streets daily to demand the release of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and a return to democracy. Normalcy seems a far-off prospect. Protesters have been facing increasing violence from police, and more recently from pro-military groups wielding knives and slingshots. The deaths of four protesters, one volunteer guard and one police officer have been linked to the conflict. Myanmar's economy is also being severely constrained amid a strengthening civil disobedience movement. Medical personnel are on the frontlines, and this has impeded the progress of the national coronavirus vaccination campaign. As well, about 90% of 4,000 container-truck drivers at Yangon's four main ports have halted work, slowing delivery of imports and prompting at least one international shipping line to halt new orders. Although drivers have said they will transport essential food, medicine and fabrics for factories, only about 30% of normal container volumes are moving through the ports via truck. Exports are also depressed as buyers seek alternative suppliers in the event of economic sanctions being imposed on Myanmar. Already the World Bank has suspended payments for development projects that it is funding in Myanmar. And Japan, a major donor, is considering halting new assistance projects for the time being. Direct economic and financial sanctions would take a heavy toll on the country given the high level of foreign direct investment (FDI) it needs. Multinationals investing from Singapore are likely to be very wary given the reputational risk of dealing with military regimes. While garment exports are likely to be the worst hit, financial sanctions imposed by the US could limit the use of the US dollar to trade and invest in Myanmar, which would be a real blow to agri-food trade. With FDI accounting for 5% of gross domestic product, investor flight due to political uncertainty and slower growth will inevitably lead to lower household incomes, with a domino effect on the consumer, manufacturing, banking and real estate sectors to just name a few. Asian countries with interests in Myanmar will be the most affected. The country's largest foreign investors include Singapore (although some of this investment originates elsewhere), Greater China, Thailand, Japan and some European countries, notably the Netherlands and the UK. With New Zealand being the first country to cut ties with Myanmar on Feb 9, western democracies and international development institutions have condemned the coup. China has avoided any statement of condemnation, though Beijing is known to be concerned because it had cultivated good relations with Aung San Suu Kyi and her civilian administration. China's relationship with Myanmar's notoriously xenophobic army has always been difficult. Under extended military rule, be it the current arrangement or a pseudo-democratic system with the governing parties backed by the military, Myanmar will be forced to turn more to China for development aid and economic support. China's interest in Myanmar has been rising as of late. In 2019 Beijing explicitly decided to focus on investing in Myanmar as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. Analysts say China probably plays a larger role in Myanmar than official figures suggest, especially in infrastructure, power and mining. Ultimately, ongoing events could add momentum to this trend. The most worrisome aspect to me is that events in Myanmar have once more highlighted and even intensified division in Asean. Indonesia, the largest economy in the region, is pushing very hard for a peaceful, Asean-led solution through dialogue to restore democracy and national reconciliation in Myanmar. Officially, Thailand and Cambodia have remained largely silent in accordance with Asean's mantra of non-interference. Myamnar's foreign minister was in Bangkok last week and it was hours before the Thai government would even admit that he had spoken to anyone. Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have expressed varying degrees of concern. Myanmar, meanwhile, seems to have rejected an offer from Brunei, the current Asean chair, to hold a special foreign ministers' meeting. Clearly, Asean is in a difficult situation to produce a consensus-based decision on a divisive issue, something it often struggles to do. Putting pressure on Myanmar potentially nudges it closer to China. That's not our desire. What we can do is to support the people of Myanmar, now at a critical juncture, to push their demand for democracy to avoid a collapsing future."
1-มี.ค.-21,12:30,Business,Pharma transformation,"The Covid-19 pandemic has created urgent demand for health innovations to better serve individuals, organisations and entire societies. The pharmaceutical industry has been on the frontlines of the challenge as it races against time to find solutions. The development of coronavirus vaccines in a matter of months is an achievement that few would have thought possible. The fact that it happened demonstrates the resilience of the sector and its ability to harness research talent to meet urgent challenges. With production now up and running, the next challenge is distribution and actually getting the shots into people's arms. This presents a new set of challenges for the public-sector side of the healthcare system. Pharmaceutical companies have also been learning on the fly about how to manage complex supply chains and new models for engaging with healthcare professionals, a largely remote workforce and the disruption of many clinical trials. Germany-based Bayer has been persevering through the pandemic, having invested heavily in external innovation with an unprecedented number of more than 25 collaboration agreements and acquisitions. The company has doubled down on its commitment to transform its business with breakthrough innovation to help patients suffering from health conditions that are still difficult to treat, executives say. ""The biomedical and technological revolution that is transforming healthcare at an unprecedented pace is taking place now. We are at the forefront of the wave of innovation in cell and gene therapy as well as digital health,"" Stefan Oelrich, president of the pharmaceuticals division and a member of the board of management at Bayer, told a virtual conference held recently to showcase the company's achievements. ""We are driving this transformation and growing our promising development portfolio together with our partners. Our joint goal is to bring breakthrough treatments to patients and make healthcare systems more sustainable in the mid- and long term."" While many of global pharma's biggest names have been busy developing and producing coronavirus vaccines over the past year, Bayer has not been directly involved. However, it announced last month that it would help produce a Covid vaccine that Germany-based CureVac is developing. Mr Oelrich said last month that the company would set aside some of its capacity to start producing the CureVac vaccine in 2022, with a target of 160 million doses in the first 12 months. CureVac began the final Phase III trials of its vaccine candidate in mid-December, involving more than 35,000 volunteers in Europe and Latin America. CELL THERAPY INNOVATION When it comes to treatment innovations, Bayer says that cell and gene therapies, for the first time, offer the possibility to address the root causes of disease. That opens up options for conditions considered intractable, or where the current standard of care only addresses symptoms to different degrees. The company has just established a new cell and gene therapy platform focusing on areas with high unmet needs, such as neurodegenerative, neuromuscular and cardiovascular conditions, Pompe disease, Parkinson's disease, haemophilia A and congestive heart failure. It now has at least 15 preclinical assets in the cell and gene therapy field in the pipeline. ""Cell and gene therapies hold the promise to significantly impact patients' lives by moving from treating symptoms to potentially curative approaches,"" said Wolfram Carius, executive vice-president and head of cell and gene therapy at Bayer. ""Together with our partners, we want to accelerate innovation at its source and along the whole value chain to ensure a fast translation of science into therapies for patients who have no time to wait."" The Bayer subsidiary BlueRock Therapeutics, an engineered cell therapy company, recently announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had cleared its application to proceed with a Phase I study in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. It will be the first trial in the US to study stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons in patients with Parkinson's, seen as a big step forward for the stem cell field. With a mission to develop regenerative medicines for intractable diseases, BlueRock's Cell+Gene platform harnesses the power of cells for new medicines for application in neurology, cardiology and autoimmune treatment. Because heart attack and stroke still represent a major health burden, more effective treatment options in thrombosis prevention are needed, according to Bayer. The company has begun a Phase II-b trial of a new anticoagulant with a plan to enrol more than 4,000 patients. It is also conducting a Phase II trial on patients with end-stage kidney disease to see if anticoagulants based on FXI-pathway inhibition could offer protection from thromboembolic events -- blood clots forming due to blood changes -- without increased risk of bleeding. Such events are a major cause of morbidity and mortality and few therapeutic options are available. Another treatment area where Bayer hopes to make progress is in endometriosis, which affects approximately 10% of women of reproductive age. Many experience severe chronic pain with debilitating effects on their professional, personal and social lives. A receptor known as P2X3 has a prominent role in endometriosis and several other medical conditions associated with pain and neurogenic hypersensitivity such as chronic cough, overactive bladder and neuropathic pain.Although these diseases are not life-threatening, they severely affect the quality of life for a large number of patients, and P2X3 antagonists could potentially offer a new treatment approach and relief. In addition, Bayer has begun Phase II-a clinical studies for overactive bladder and diabetic neuropathic pain. ""Our research in the fields of Factor XI inhibitors and P2X3 antagonists are just two promising examples of mid-stage programmes that demonstrate our ongoing commitment to building and advancing a strong development pipeline,"" Mr Oelrich said. The last trial stage is also under way of a potential blockbuster product that extends survival for men with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The product has received regulatory approval in the US, the European Union (EU), Brazil, Canada and Japan. A Phase III study on hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is expected to start producing data this year. In the field of women's healthcare, Bayer plans to start Phase III trials this year of a treatment for vasomotor symptoms or hot flashes and night sweats during menopause. As they start to chart a post-Covid future, healthcare systems in Asia Pacific are under pressure to do more to achieve long-term resilience to better serve their growing and ageing populations. It's clear that a one-size-fits-all approach is no longer enough, but the good news is that technological and treatment advances are making a new era of personalised healthcare more possible. According to the Asia Pacific Personalised Health Index, released recently by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the readiness of countries across the region for personalised healthcare varies significantly. The greatest strengths in the region are in health information, helped by a robust and growing digital infrastructure. On the other hand, there are stark contrasts in policy and planning for personalised healthcare, indicating differences in regulatory and innovative capacity and potential for implementation, the survey's authors said. Access to and use of personalised technologies and health services also varies significantly across the region. These disparities reflect a variety of factors, from differing national priorities, healthcare financing models and levels of healthcare coverage to social and environmental conditions. The index measures performance based on 27 different indicators of personalised health across four main categories known as Vital Signs: policy context, health information, personalised technologies, and health services. It is drawn from data that is publicly available, supplemented with input from public health authorities and validated by a panel of healthcare experts. The health systems covered are in Australia, China, Japan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and New Zealand. Initiated by the FutureProofing Healthcare Initiative, with assistance from the Switzerland-based pharmaceutical group Roche, the index is intended to promote better understanding of local, national and regional strengths and needs, leading to better policies to build resilience in health systems. Singapore performed the best of all the countries and territories measured. It was singled out for its combination of high digital maturity, comprehensive national strategies, a strong infrastructure and expansive innovation capacity, leading to top scores in both the health information and personalised technologies categories. Taiwan, Japan and Australia also performed well in overall readiness. However, even higher-performing countries have numerous areas of opportunity for improvement. Challenges related to urban-rural disparities and building digital infrastructure affect lower-scoring countries, several of which are at the very early stages of personalised healthcare. Thailand, meanwhile, is in the process of formulating and implementing plans to enable personalised healthcare. The country has strong data collection capabilities that can support limited aspects of personalised care, the survey said. Strengthening the digital infrastructure, increasing investment in research and development, further streamlining regulatory processes, improving access to digital health services and technologies and building capacity in the healthcare workforce are potential focus areas for Thailand, the survey's authors said. In addition, there is a need for an emphasis on health equity to address issues of access and quality in Thailand as it makes its transition to personalised healthcare."
1-มี.ค.-21,12:30,Business,Supply chain bottlenecks in Vietnam,"Vietnam's economy has fared better than that of almost any other country except China during the Covid-19 crisis. It grew by 2.9% last year while most other countries fell into recession. One consequence of the crisis was that manufacturers realised the importance of diversifying supply chains, and many accelerated the China Plus One policies that they had initiated because of the US-China trade war. This led to a surge of investment in Vietnam from global manufacturers last year. Economic activity was also supported by higher demand for certain consumer products as people around the world spent more time at home during lockdowns. Vietnam's exports of home furniture and accessories rose dramatically, as did exports of phones, computers and electronics. While this was good news for the country's balance of payments, the increased activity put pressure on its supply chain which struggled to keep up with the demand. Other countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, also faced supply chain problems such as shortages of containers, long delays in shipping, backlogs of cargo and skyrocketing freight prices. Problems worsened due to the New Year holiday when many truckers headed home only to face quarantine restrictions that created further delays and bottlenecks at regional ports. These current difficulties won't deter global manufacturers from continuing to flock to Vietnam -- major multinationals including Apple, Samsung and LG Electronics are already outsourcing production to Vietnam as are other companies including those from Thailand. This is turn will boost regional trade as Vietnam will need to import many components from elsewhere in the region. This situation highlights the need for more and better transport infrastructure connecting the region, and more overland alternatives to congested shipping ports and sea lanes. Vietnam's government has prioritised infrastructure development to mitigate problems. About half a dozen projects are in the pipeline, including a new national highway and an airport that is being built outside Ho Chi Minh City. Local governments have also been directed to speed up their investment programmes and last year state investment rose by 14.5%. Other countries in the region are also supporting Vietnam's infrastructure development. China, Japan and South Korea are investing in major construction projects, Thailand in energy development, and Singapore is supporting the modernisation of its logistics industry. With growing economic connectivity, all the countries in the region have a keen interest in solving bottlenecks and supply chain problems -- our future economic prosperity depends on each other.

1-มี.ค.-21,12:30,Business,Don't isolate Myanmar,"Directly or indirectly, the military has always called the shots in Myanmar. And now that it has removed the decade-old façade of gradual democratisation by detaining civilian leaders and seizing power, Western calls to punish the country with sanctions and international isolation are growing louder. Heeding them would be a mistake. The retreat of the ""Myanmar spring"" means all the countries of continental Southeast Asia -- Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar -- are under authoritarian rule, like their giant northern neighbour, China. More fundamentally, the reversal of democratisation in Myanmar is a reminder that democracy is unlikely to take root where authoritarian leaders and institutions remain deeply entrenched. Given this, a punitive approach would merely express democratic countries' disappointment, at the cost of stalling Myanmar's economic liberalisation, impeding the development of its civil society and reversing its shift toward closer engagement with democratic powers. And, as in the past, the brunt of sanctions would be borne by ordinary citizens, not the generals. This is a realistic scenario. US President Joe Biden has warned that the military's action ""will necessitate an immediate review of our sanctions laws"", followed by ""appropriate action"". But he would do well to consider how US-led sanctions in the past pushed Myanmar into China's strategic lap, exacerbating regional-security challenges. Sanctions are a blunt instrument. Thailand's now-retired army chief has remained ensconced in power in civilian garb since staging a coup in 2014. Yet if the United States can do business with Thailand, where a crackdown on pro-democracy protesters has extended to the use of the feared lèse-majesté law, why hold neighbouring Myanmar to a higher standard? Likewise, the US, India, Japan and others have established close defence ties with communist-ruled Vietnam. Indeed, the US boasts that in recent years it has established a ""robust security partnership"" with Hanoi. Only by opening lines of communication and cooperation with Myanmar's generals can democratic powers hope to influence developments in a strategically important country. In the past decade, as Myanmar's democratic transition unfolded, the West neglected to build close relations with the force behind it -- the military. Instead, the prevailing Anglo-American approach centred on Aung San Suu Kyi, making her bigger than the cause. That neglect persisted even after Aung San Suu Kyi fell from grace over the fate of the country's Rohingya Muslims, many of whom fled to Bangladesh and some to India during a brutal military campaign to flush out militants waging hit-and-run attacks. The West's lopsided approach eventually contributed to the Feb 1 coup. Today, the US has little influence over Myanmar's military. The coup leader, Gen Min Aung Hlaing, and his deputy, Gen Soe Win, were slapped with US sanctions 14 months ago over the expulsion of the Rohingya. But in responding to the mass detention of Muslims in Xinjiang that it labels ""genocide"", the US has spared top Chinese military and party officials, imposing largely symbolic sanctions against lower-ranking functionaries. Despite their uneven effectiveness and unpredictable consequences, sanctions have remained a favourite -- and grossly overused -- instrument of Western diplomacy, especially when dealing with the small kids on the global bloc. Non-Western democracies, in contrast, prefer constructive engagement. Japan, for example, has a partnership programme with Myanmar's military that includes capacity-building support and training. Likewise, India's defence ties with Myanmar extend to joint exercises and operations and supply of military hardware; recently, it gave its neighbour its first submarine. Such ties also seek to counter China's supply of arms and other aid to Indian tribal insurgents through rebel-controlled northern Myanmar. Sanctions without engagement have never worked. Crippling US-led sanctions from the late 1980s paved the way for China to become Myanmar's dominant trading partner and investor. But in 2011, Myanmar's bold suspension of a controversial Chinese megaproject, the Myitsone dam, became a watershed moment for the country's democratic opening. It set in motion developments that reduced Myanmar's dependence on China, balanced its foreign policy and spurred domestic reforms. Today, nothing would serve Chinese interests more than new US-led efforts to isolate Myanmar, which serves China as a strategic gateway to the Indian Ocean and important source of natural resources. In fact, renewed sanctions and isolation would likely turn Myanmar into another Chinese satellite, like Laos, Cambodia and Pakistan. US policymakers must not ignore how often American sanctions against other countries have worked to China's advantage. They should perhaps be most worried by how sanctions have forced Russia to pivot to China, turning two natural competitors into close strategic partners. And China has been the main trade and investment beneficiary of US sanctions against Iran. In this light, the US must take a prudent approach to Myanmar. When Mr Biden has expressed a readiness to cooperate with the world's largest autocracy, China, in areas of mutual interest, he should at least pursue a similar approach with a far weaker Myanmar, where the military is the only functioning institution.

1-มี.ค.-21,9:45,Business,Hopes for WTO momentum as new boss takes charge,"GENEVA: Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala takes over the World Trade Organization on Monday amid hopes that she will spur the beleaguered body into addressing its towering challenges, including the pandemic-fuelled global economic crisis. ""The WTO is too important to allow it to be slowed down, paralysed and moribund,"" the first woman and first African to ever lead the global trade body told AFP a day after her nomination last month. The 66-year-old Nigerian former finance minister takes the helm after the WTO was left adrift for seven months following the sudden departure of Brazilian career diplomat Roberto Azevedo last August, a year ahead of schedule. Following a lengthy selection process, development economist Okonjo-Iweala, who spent 25 years at the World Bank, was finally anointed by the WTO's 164 members on February 15. From an initial eight candidates, she was the clear favourite among the last two standing in November. However, her appointment was delayed by former US president Donald Trump blocking her nomination. The arrival of his successor Joe Biden made it possible for her to receive the consensus backing required to end the impasse. - In at the deep end - She is hitting the ground running, with her first day on the job in Geneva coinciding with the annual meeting of WTO's General Council. Delegates are expected to agree that the organisation's next ministerial conference, which had been scheduled for last year but was postponed due to the pandemic, will be held in Geneva in December. The question remains whether the new WTO chief, considered a strong-willed trailblazer, will be able to mould the organisation in her image before then. While some observers voice hope that Okonjo-Iweala will inject much-needed energy, others stress she has little wiggle room to make dramatic change, given that WTO decisions are made by member states -- and only when they can reach consensus. One of her first tasks will be to nominate four new deputy directors to help recharge the organisation's negotiating mechanisms. Okonjo-Iweala has said that one of her main objectives is to push long-blocked trade talks on fishery subsidies across the finish line in time for the ministerial conference, but with negotiations dragging on, that could be a tough sell. And in the midst of a global economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, she has plenty of other challenges on her plate. Okonjo-Iweala has voiced concern about growing protectionism and nationalism during the coronavirus crisis and insists trade barriers must be lowered to help the world recover. - Vaccines IP wrangle - Among the issues to be discussed Monday is a controversial push for the WTO to waive intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines. Dozens of nations say this would help boost production and access and would rein in the pandemic sooner, but the notion has been fiercely rejected by pharmaceutical giants and the countries that host them. Okonjo-Iweala chaired the Gavi vaccine alliance before running for the WTO and has made tackling the pandemic another of her priorities. In a likely bid to avoid a row on day one, Ngozi has called for flexibility, encouraging voluntary licencing agreements, such as the one agreed between AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India, whereby the SII factory manufactures the pharmaceutical giant's Covid-19 vaccines. The Ottawa Group, which brings together the EU and 12 countries including Brazil, Canada and Switzerland, will meanwhile demand that countries commit not to hinder the flow of medical goods during the pandemic, and remove customs duties on those considered essential. Another daunting challenge facing the new director-general will be following through on her vow to breathe life back into the appeals branch of the WTO's dispute settlement system. The Appellate Body, sometimes called the supreme court of world trade, ground to a halt in December 2019 after years of relentless US opposition. The United States, along with European countries and Canada, want an overhaul at the WTO, believing it has not responded correctly to the trade distortions caused by China."
1-มี.ค.-21,9:30,Business,What's Missing in the Electric-Vehicle Revolution: Enough Places to Plug In,"Bradley Wilkinson is the owner of a 2017 Chevrolet Bolt, and the kind of electric-vehicle diehard who knows how to squeeze every last mile of range out of his vehicle. Even so, during his most recent road trip, from Tampa, Florida, back home to Fort Carson, Colorado, he spent about 58 hours on the road. In a gasoline-powered vehicle, on average, the 1,900-mile journey would take about 30. His relatively sluggish pace was due to his need to regularly power up the Bolt's battery at a ""fast"" charger -- so called because they're many times faster than typical home chargers. Less experienced EV owners report far bigger inconveniences than Mr. Wilkinson's. Those include: too few charging stations, too much demand at the stations that are available, broken chargers, confusing payment systems, exorbitant electricity rates, and uncertainty over how long their cars need to charge. While EVs can be powered up at home, industry analysts and academics believe that a fast-charging infrastructure is essential to getting beyond their current limited adoption. This next wave of slightly-less-early adopters is critical to a global automotive industry betting heavily on battery power.Yet so far, only one carmaker has offered a reassuring pitch about conveniently and reliably recharging on the go: Tesla. And Tesla's fast-charging technology doesn't work on non-Tesla cars. Building the requisite charging infrastructure for the rest of the EV universe will be expensive. The Biden administration has proposed building a network of 500,000 chargers in the next five years, which would cost billions. The fact that many believe such a government investment is required shows just how little faith many industry insiders have in the ability of private enterprise to solve this problem. One issue: Building out the nation's charging infrastructure might not be profitable. Say what you will about the fit and finish of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's EVs, or his over-the-top promises of imminent self-driving technology, the one thing his company got right from its early days is charging, says Hemant K. Bhargava, director of the Center for Analytics and Technology at UC Davis. Tesla built a nationwide fast-charging infrastructure for its vehicles even before its cars were widely adopted. During the development and rollout of Tesla's car-and-charger platform, the company offered to allow other companies to use the patents on its charging standards and equipment, but none took it up on the offer. While Tesla offered ""open source"" charging technology, using it meant signing off on terms the world's biggest automakers were unwilling to accept. The world's automakers collectively adopted a competing standard in the U.S., making their vehicles incompatible with Tesla's. (Notably, the reverse isn't true: With an adapter, Teslas can charge at nearly all fast-charging stations.) In the automobile's earliest days, motorists couldn't always be sure a fueling station would be available when they needed it. But we no longer think about fuel availability when we shop for conventional cars. In 2019, there were approximately 128,000 retail gas stations in the U.S. Adding up every kind of fast-charging station in the U.S., there are still only 4,890 of them, according to the Department of Energy. Traditional car makers, with their sights set on a battery-only future, are aware of the charging problem. One effort to match Tesla's superchargers has resulted in Electrify America, a nationwide network of fast-charging stations. Its creator, Volkswagen, agreed to invest $2 billion as part of the settlement with the U.S. government and California over its Dieselgate emissions-testing scandal. Other nationwide networks such as ChargePoint and EVGo, which primarily offer the slower sort of chargers, are now adding fast-charge technology. (The kind of charging that happens at home tops out at a maximum of 7.2 kw. Fast charging is 50kw and up.) The result, for EV drivers who wish to take their vehicles on road trips -- as well as the many city-dwelling EV owners who are unable to charge at home -- is a patchwork of stations that many say is improving but still needs work. In a survey of 3,500 EV drivers conducted in September and October 2020 by EV advocacy group Plug In America, more than half reported having problems with public charging. These problems were worse for respondents who drove non-Tesla vehicles; almost 60% of those reported issues. The most common complaint was a non-functional charger. On a recent drive to Key West, Florida., from his home of Raleigh, North Carolina, Chris Maxwell found that out of 31 stops at fast chargers -- all but one in the Electrify America network -- one in five had problems, and were either completely inoperable or only charged at half their rated speed. He was towing a heavy trailer, so he only got 120 miles per charge on his Audi e-tron SUV, hence all the stops. Even with all the hiccups, the Electrify America network is far more reliable than it was even just a year ago, says Mr. Maxwell. Also, charging stations, unlike gas stations, aren't designed to accommodate cars with trailers. ""The charging station at Charlotte in particular is kind of the bane of my existence,"" Mr. Maxwell says. Because of its physical configuration, this station is a tricky place to charge a vehicle that has a trailer attached. Think of Tesla, a vertically integrated platform in control of the technology in both its vehicles and chargers, like Apple, which controls everything from its microchips to its app store, says Prof. Bhargava. The rest of the automakers are like the many manufacturers of Android phones, he says. Only in the current charging environment, there's no Google to direct all those manufacturers. For starters, each EV model's battery can have a different capacity and charge time. In addition, every automaker must interpret a set of open standards for the plug type, charging protocols and payment methods. Even when chargers are fully functional, issues can arise such as plugs becoming unseated, chargers rebooting, and cars and chargers having trouble communicating, all of which can interrupt a charging session or lead to longer charge times. Robert Barrosa, senior director of sales and marketing at Electrify America, says his company registers every failed charging session initiated by a customer, and attempts to find patterns across different models of chargers and vehicles. Many stakeholders -- from automakers and charging companies to utilities and state and federal agencies -- have an interest in a reliable national network of fast chargers, says Mark Wakefield, a managing director and automotive consultant at AlixPartners. But if the sole source of income for these charging stations is from dispensing electricity, he adds, it doesn't appear they're a viable business. According to an analysis AlixPartners conducted last year, the average fast-charging station, charging market price for electricity, would take 20 to 25 years to pay off its initial investment. Part of the problem is that when in use, a single fast-charging stall can draw the equivalent of a whole neighborhood's electricity needs. So it can be very expensive to connect a station with up to a dozen individual chargers to the local electrical grid, and secure enough energy supply. Tesla offsets the cost of its fast-charging network through sales of vehicles and lucrative regulatory credits, and has only recently started turning a profit after years of losses. And Electrify America's network was part of Volkswagen's settlement. But these two means of paying for a fast-charging network aren't the only ones, says Katherine Stainken, policy director at Plug In America. An alternative is to use the federal grant money from the Biden administration to encourage private businesses to set up, and partially fund, their own charging stations. For example, a restaurant on an interstate or in an area with a high density of EVs could apply for funding, then chip in some of its own money, and perhaps also partner with a private fast-charging network company, in order to build a charging station. (The restaurant's incentive would be that a fast charger could increase business while drivers wait.) EVs currently make up around 2% of vehicles sold each year in the U.S., and the Department of Energy says more than 80% of EV charging happens at home. More than half of Americans live in single-family dwellings where, in theory, an EV could be charged, and 63% of all U.S. housing units of every kind have a garage or carport. But any EV owners planning a trip far from home, or who can't charge at home, must rely on apps to plot an efficient route and ensure they don't get stranded. Chargeway, for instance, automatically calculates where drivers should stop on a given route in order to spend the least amount of time charging their vehicles. The company gathers detailed information about how fast chargers can ""fuel"" any given vehicle -- which depends both on the type of vehicle and the capacity of the charger, says Chargeway chief executive Matt Teske, a veteran of the auto industry. Mr. Wilkinson, the Bolt driver, uses a similar, competing app, called A Better Route Planner. The mindset required to make EV road trips, or even just drive an EV regularly if you can't charge it at home, is markedly different from what Americans are used to. And that probably won't change until we have a critical mass of charging stations. ""A gas-powered Mustang might get 350 miles to a tank,"" says Mr. Teske, ""but nobody talks about range anxiety in that vehicle."" "
1-มี.ค.-21,12:30,Opinion,Can Myanmar be saved?,"After a month under military rule, Myanmar remains gripped by anger and frustration. Despite the growing danger to their personal safety, thousands of people continue to hit the streets daily to demand the release of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and a return to democracy. Normalcy seems a far-off prospect. Protesters have been facing increasing violence from police, and more recently from pro-military groups wielding knives and slingshots. The deaths of four protesters, one volunteer guard and one police officer have been linked to the conflict. Myanmar's economy is also being severely constrained amid a strengthening civil disobedience movement. Medical personnel are on the frontlines, and this has impeded the progress of the national coronavirus vaccination campaign. As well, about 90% of 4,000 container-truck drivers at Yangon's four main ports have halted work, slowing delivery of imports and prompting at least one international shipping line to halt new orders. Although drivers have said they will transport essential food, medicine and fabrics for factories, only about 30% of normal container volumes are moving through the ports via truck. Exports are also depressed as buyers seek alternative suppliers in the event of economic sanctions being imposed on Myanmar. Already the World Bank has suspended payments for development projects that it is funding in Myanmar. And Japan, a major donor, is considering halting new assistance projects for the time being. Direct economic and financial sanctions would take a heavy toll on the country given the high level of foreign direct investment (FDI) it needs. Multinationals investing from Singapore are likely to be very wary given the reputational risk of dealing with military regimes. While garment exports are likely to be the worst hit, financial sanctions imposed by the US could limit the use of the US dollar to trade and invest in Myanmar, which would be a real blow to agri-food trade. With FDI accounting for 5% of gross domestic product, investor flight due to political uncertainty and slower growth will inevitably lead to lower household incomes, with a domino effect on the consumer, manufacturing, banking and real estate sectors to just name a few. Asian countries with interests in Myanmar will be the most affected. The country's largest foreign investors include Singapore (although some of this investment originates elsewhere), Greater China, Thailand, Japan and some European countries, notably the Netherlands and the UK. With New Zealand being the first country to cut ties with Myanmar on Feb 9, western democracies and international development institutions have condemned the coup. China has avoided any statement of condemnation, though Beijing is known to be concerned because it had cultivated good relations with Aung San Suu Kyi and her civilian administration. China's relationship with Myanmar's notoriously xenophobic army has always been difficult. Under extended military rule, be it the current arrangement or a pseudo-democratic system with the governing parties backed by the military, Myanmar will be forced to turn more to China for development aid and economic support. China's interest in Myanmar has been rising as of late. In 2019 Beijing explicitly decided to focus on investing in Myanmar as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. Analysts say China probably plays a larger role in Myanmar than official figures suggest, especially in infrastructure, power and mining. Ultimately, ongoing events could add momentum to this trend. The most worrisome aspect to me is that events in Myanmar have once more highlighted and even intensified division in Asean. Indonesia, the largest economy in the region, is pushing very hard for a peaceful, Asean-led solution through dialogue to restore democracy and national reconciliation in Myanmar. Officially, Thailand and Cambodia have remained largely silent in accordance with Asean's mantra of non-interference. Myamnar's foreign minister was in Bangkok last week and it was hours before the Thai government would even admit that he had spoken to anyone. Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have expressed varying degrees of concern. Myanmar, meanwhile, seems to have rejected an offer from Brunei, the current Asean chair, to hold a special foreign ministers' meeting. Clearly, Asean is in a difficult situation to produce a consensus-based decision on a divisive issue, something it often struggles to do. Putting pressure on Myanmar potentially nudges it closer to China. That's not our desire. What we can do is to support the people of Myanmar, now at a critical juncture, to push their demand for democracy to avoid a collapsing future."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,Opinion,Anti-coup crackdown takes fatal turn,"Myanmar's security forces have unleashed a concerted crackdown on the country's peaceful protesters leaving 23 dead and thousands injured throughout the country in the last two days. In planned pre-emptive strikes, the police moved ruthlessly to disperse and arrest protestors preparing to join yesterday general strike. ""They used teargas, stun grenades and fired live ammunition indiscriminately into the crowds,"" said Soe Soe, a young university student at a protest site told the Bangkok Post. In response to the shooting of unarmed civilians, Myanmar's special envoy to the UN called on the international community to bring the authorities to justice for ""crimes against humanity"". ""It's time for the international community to act to protect our innocent, defenceless people who dare to stand up to these thugs who now controlling our country,"" said Dr Sa Sa, who is the special envoy appointed by the committee representing the elected MPs from the majority National League for Democracy (NLD). Dr Sa Sa told the Bangkok Post in an extensive interview that the regional group Asean -- due to have a digital Foreign Minister's special meeting today at which the situation in Myanmar will be discussed -- ""should isolate and punish Myanmar for ignoring concerns about avoiding bloodshed and not protecting its people"". ""Asean should not talk to the military -- don't give them credibility -- don't accept them, don't give these generals any legitimacy,"" he insisted. At the very least, he said Asean should consider suspending Myanmar from Asean, if they do not abide by the rules. Other organisations suspend or expel member states if they do not conform to the rules or expectations -- like the Commonwealth, an organisation of former British colonies of which Myanmar used to be a member. ""We may be a family, but if someone misbehaves they have to be punished -- they can't be allowed to get away with impunity -- more serious action is needed,"" he appealed to the leaders of the regional bloc. ""Likewise if a family member gets sick, the whole family is affected,"" he said. All the more with the region's heavy interdependence and interconnectivity -- economically, socially, culturally and demographically, he added. This weekend was the turning point in the continued confrontation between the security forces and the unarmed, non-violent civil disobedience movement demonstrating in the streets for the past four weeks against the coup. International condemnation has been swift and strong, but the protestors are demanding immediate intervention. ""Protestors are being shot: We are very angry, we are very upset,"" Sakura, a young graduate in Yangon, told the Bangkok Post. ""How many dead bodies does the UN need to act?"" she asked, after spending the morning protesting and surveying the carnage on the streets of Yangon yesterday. In the past week the junta leaders have been ratcheting up the pressure on the protestors: threats, intimidation and arrests. Clear crowd control measures were being planned and put into place, and street patrols stepped up. Parts of the country's main cities -- especially Yangon, Nay Pyi Taw and Mandalay -- were cordoned off, with barricades and blockades erected to enable police and soldiers to clear the crowds more easily using riot shields and baton charges. Clearly rehearsals for yesterday's devastating relentless attack on the protestors -- but with unlimited firepower and live ammunition. The police have continued to indiscriminately arrest protesters in the streets during the day -- though many are later released after signing a form promising not to protest in future. There was also a massive sweep against civil servants active in the civil disobedience campaign, with police making surgical strikes in the middle of the night on the homes of suspected protest leaders and political activists, including NLD politicians. The numbers of those detained rises day by day which makes it difficult to confirm a definitive figure. Political prisoner groups, who monitor arrests, estimate that since the start of the coup over a thousand had been detained. Monitors believe at least two thousand people were detained over the weekend: authenticated videos and photos on social media show hundreds of doctors and nurse being rounded up and hauled away in trucks in many cities throughout Myanmar yesterday. Similar pictures show lines of teachers and university lecturers being carted off. Most of those arrested who have not been released, have not been arraigned or had a bail hearing. And much worse have not been allowed access to a lawyer -- including Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's civilian leader, whose trial is due to commence later today. All of this is really a gross infringement of the rule of law -- despite the junta having neatly revised the law after the coup to allow for indefinite detention, according to legal experts. This is rule by orders -- as in the 1988 coup -- and is intended to disguise the illegitimacy of their military regime: it is selective legality, according to the Australian lawyer and constitutional expert Janelle Saffin who has been advising on legal and parliamentary matters in Myanmar over the past ten years. ""It's rule by orders, it's only to effect legality. What's more, it's unconstitutional,"" she said. ""The changes to the penal code to detain people longer than 24 hours and without a judicial order, violates Section 376 of their own 2008 constitution,"" she told the Bangkok Post. ""We are a non-violent movement, our weapons are our voice, our mobile phones and social media,"" reflected Dr Sa Sa. ""It's the army that are committing crimes. These are the ones who facing real criminal charges and international justice at the Hague [at the International Court Justice], they are the ones who should be in prison … not our leaders [referring to Aung San Suu Kyi and other NLD leaders] … they must be made accountable for their crimes."" On this day, when Myanmar experienced the worst violence in its tragic history since 1988, attention clearly shifts to the international community. Pressure is bound to build in the capitals of the West -- Washington, Brussels, London and Tokyo -- to take swift action, it will no doubt to be referred again to the UN Security Council with the UK in the presidency, and it will reverberate around the capitals of Asia -- Asean, Beijing and Delhi. Myanmar's security forces have crossed the line, and Min Aung Hlaing and his coup cohorts will be asked to have to be brought to book, according to Dr Sa Sa. Until now, the West has blown its trumpet loudly but been ineffectual in practice; India, Japan and much of Asean has remained quiet waiting to see developments. Indonesia and Thailand were quick to understand the enormous potential ramifications for the region if Myanmar's political crisis got out of control and ended in bloodshed. The region also has faced Washington's aggressive bullying on one hand a subtle pressure from Beijing. Asean thought it had got itself out ahead of the game, with the planned special foreign ministers' meeting tomorrow to discuss Covid and other matters, a euphemism for Myanmar, but now all eyes will be on that meeting -- the first diplomatic get-together since the bloodshed. One thing the international community has insisted on publicly and behind the scenes was for the new Myanmar regime to release Ms Suu Kyi and the other political leaders and to do their utmost to avoid bloodshed. That was Asean's clear message last week during the attempted ""shuttle diplomacy"". Most countries involved in Myanmar are singing more or less from the same hymn book. But now more than ever there will be demands for an internationally-sponsored mediation process, though that is difficult to envisage at this stage. But the role of Beijing in the coming days and weeks is going to prove critical in trying to sort out the political quagmire Myanmar has placed the region in. The coup leader and army chief General Min Aung Hlaing flew to China on Saturday evening, according to reliable sources close to the military. So far there been no official confirmation from either side. ""While the world and Myanmar waits to see the result of international negotiations, we must maintain political pressure, economic pressure and international pressure on the generals, "" said Dr Sa Sa. ""The international community must recognise the results of these 2020 elections -- they were free and fair -- the people have spoken loud and clear, they overwhelmingly chose us [the NLD] to represent them. The international community must understand that a democratic Myanmar would be a really good ally; when we have democracy, a flourishing democracy, the country will grow and develop, and everyone will benefit.""

1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,Opinion,Real access is key to women's participation,"Almost one month separates the International Day of Women and Girls in Science on Feb 11 and the International Women's Day on March 8, but the two are becoming increasingly related, if not in time at least in the achievements they want to mark. The former was established in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly to encourage more girls and women to pursue studies and careers in science and technology. The latter celebrates the achievements of women in social, cultural, economic and political fields and advance gender parity. But these achievements will struggle to progress without increased participation of women in science, technology and innovation, especially in a highly digitalised post-pandemic world. This is particularly important for the Asean region, one of the fastest growing digital economies in the world, whose growth has been accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic. With a growing proportion of our daily activities moving online, equal access to digital technology and participation in online professional activities is key to an inclusive post-pandemic recovery. And equal access means the same opportunities to compete, thrive and access leadership positions. Any foreigner living and working in Southeast Asia can be quickly impressed and positively surprised by the numerous highly qualified women met during meetings and professional events, certainly in higher numbers than in other regions around the world. While at first sight, this partial and unresearched anecdotal evidence is very positive, but when looking at the data, it is clear that there still a long way to go. Recent Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) research shows that compared to other regions in Asia, Asean women are doing well in terms of basic digital access metrics (mobile phone usage, connection to the internet, etc.) and according to a 2018 McKinsey assessment, Asean Member States scored higher than the Asia-Pacific average with respect to gender digital inclusion. For this type of access, it is reasonable to imagine that other ""divides"" such as the urban-rural divide are more predominant and significant than the gender-divide (women vs men/girls vs boys). However, when it comes to sophisticated forms of access to scientific information and digital technologies, it becomes evident that opportunities are not the same. Participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is good (although skewed towards medical disciplines and less towards information technology fields). But high female education in technical fields does not appear to translate into equally high female representation in related professions. Women have limited representation in advanced technology jobs that require higher skill levels and are better-paying. These skills and jobs are increasingly becoming in high demand for a transition towards a highly digitised post-pandemic world. When looking at entrepreneurship and innovation, while many Asean women are entrepreneurs, it is important to remember that the majority of them owns and manages micro or small enterprises, which typically make more limited usage of sophisticated digital tools, if any. This means that women entrepreneurs across Asean are at risk of lagging behind when competing in the digital market-place. Senior management and leadership positions in the business sector is another area where there is room for improvement. Unfortunately, globally and across Asean in particular, there is no systematically collected data on female representation in management positions in technology-related industries. However, research in different countries and contexts points to a lack of women in top-management and executive positions. In addition to social equality principles, there are economic benefits to including women in senior management. A recent report by the International Finance Corporation and the Economist Intelligence Unit found that companies across Asean with more than 30% female board members performed better financially than companies with fewer female board members. Participation in leadership positions in policymaking is also important because of the power of policy and regulation to shape the behaviour of institutions and societies. Diversity of representation at policymaking levels is necessary to ensure that the perspectives and realities of different populations are factored into policy initiatives. In the digital sector, this includes national policymaking bodies responsible for information and communications technology, science and education policy, and regulation for example. It is difficult to think about how to solve problems like cyberviolence, discrimination, biases, stereotypes or fake news affecting women within and outside the digital space without adequate representations of women in decision-making rooms. And these issues are becoming increasingly urgent to reflect upon and tackle as we increase the time we spend studying, meeting and working online. It is not enough for women and girls to have access to the digital economy: the types of access also matter. The ability of women to progress into senior and top-management and policymaking roles determines the extent to which women can have an equal voice in the development of systems and rules that affect their lives. Women need to have access to equal opportunities offered by innovations and emerging technologies not for being in ""survival mode"" but to be able to compete and thrive in a highly digitalised post-pandemic world. Then we can really celebrate these two important days meant to mark women's achievement.

1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,Opinion,Charter rejig ties MPs up in knots,"Staunch royalist and conformist Senator Somchai Sawaengkarn recently complained about he and his colleagues' failed attempts to make the amendment of the 2017 military-sponsored constitution more difficult. In a Facebook post on Friday night, Mr Somchai listed some of those failed attempts, in the form of reservations to proposed constitutional amendments, which were all voted down in parliament. These include the proposed change of the majority from three-fifths to two-thirds of members of the Senate and House needed to endorse charter amendments in the first and third hearings; mixed composition (selection and election) of the 200-member Constitution Drafting Committee instead of all 200 being elected by the people; incorporating 38 sections related to the King's powers, scattered in the charter, into one chapter in a new charter to be drafted by the CDC, and that CDC members not be allowed to hold political posts for two years. But despite these failed attempts, Senator Somchai and Palang Pracharat MP Paiboon Nititawan, also a staunch royalist, recently sprang a surprise by submitting a motion in parliament requesting it ask the Constitutional Court to rule on the legitimacy of attempts by the government and opposition parties to rewrite the charter through the CDC. The motion was approved by parliament, thanks to the overwhelming support of the military-backing senators. To deliberate this complicated legal issue, the court has sought opinions from four experts in the field, namely Meechai Ruchupan, the architect of the 2017 constitution; Bovornsak Uwanno, former secretary of the Constitution Drafting Committee which crafted the so-called 1997 People's Constitution, and two other constitutional experts, Udom Rat-amarit and Somkid Lertpaiboon.The nine-member Court is due to meet on March 4 to consider the motion by Mr Somchai and Mr Paiboon. A ruling is expected on March 10. Mr Udom, one of the constitution experts, said rewriting the whole charter by means of amending Section 256 to pave the way for the setting up of the CDC is not legally possible without the prior consent of the people who endorsed the charter in a referendum three years ago. He said the true spirit of Section 256 is to allow the charter to be amended section by section, not all at once, which he likened to ""tearing up"" the whole document. Mr Udom claimed that nowhere in this world has a constitution been crafted in order to be rewritten in its entirety. In his opinion, he said the only possible way to rewrite the charter is to hold a referendum to ask the people whether they agree with the move or not. It has been agreed by government and opposition parties, except the Move Forward Party, that the current charter will be rewritten by the CDC without touching two chapters, Chapter 1 concerning general provisions, including Thai sovereignty and its constitutional monarchy, and Chapter 2 which is solely about the monarchy. The MFP wants the monarchy to be reformed through constitutional amendments in line with demands of the anti-establishment Ratsadon group. But their goal is unlikely to be achieved due to stiff resistance from pro-monarchy groups such as Thai Pakdee and the military, particularly in wake of the weakening of the Ratsadon group due to internal conflict and a lack of popular support. As the Constitutional Court judges are mostly conformists and handpicked by the military junta, the likelihood is that they will vote down the attempt to rewrite the charter via the CDC. That means that government and opposition parties will revert to amending the charter section by section -- a time-consuming process. In the meantime, the government can sit back and feel comfortable with over 200 senators still in its pocket. Whatever, the flawed charter must be amended before the next election to sweep away unfair rules designed to ensure there could only be one result, such as the appointment and empowerment of partial senators and the distorted way of calculating seats in the House. However, a section-by-section rewrite, a clear delaying tactic, has one major drawback: it may provide a pretext for the anti-establishment movement to regroup and renew its protests in a more forceful fashion.

However, no matter how good a plan is, it won't succeed without serious execution. They agreed to postpone the establishment of high-level units which need to be commanded by a two-star general. Another key change, he said, involves reducing the number of ""experts"", ""specialists"" and ""special experts"" appointed as generals. When such experts retire, they won't be replaced. The exact number of generals in the Thai armed forces isn't disclosed, but it has been estimated to be between 1,500-1,700. Some critics have said the number of generals in Thailand's armed forces is the highest in Asia or even the world. Such estimates, even without confirmation, are highly likely. One of the root causes which drives up the number of generals in the military is the nation's patronage system. It is considered tradition within the RTAF that retiring senior officers, especially those who graduated from the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School and other higher military academies, are promoted as generals as a reward for their long service, without taking into consideration their actual performance. These generals won't be assigned commanding duties. Instead, they are given advisory roles within the forces as ""experts"", roles that are inactive and typically redundant. In some cases, promotions and roles as expert advisers are offered as consolation prizes to senior officers who missed out on key, commanding positions. In fact, a foreign observer has estimated that only 150-200 four-star generals are in actual commanding positions. Thailand's military has about 330,000 troops. At the end of last year, the United States, which has about 1.3 million military personnel, has only 434 two- to four-star generals. In light of such comparisons, some Thai generals have argued the military structure of the two countries is different and should not be compared, but the starkly different figures reflect some serious flaws on Thailand's side. The move represented a much-needed revamp of Thailand's armed forces, but such proposals are not new. In 2008, the Defence Council launched a 20-year plan to drastically cut the number of generals by 50%. At that time, the armed forces had 768 generals in ""expert"" roles -- the plan was to cut it to 384 by 2028. The plan, however, was never implemented. According to the Royal Gazette, 238 officers were promoted as major generals in 2008. Over the past five years, promotions to two-star generals have remained high -- 374 officers were promoted last year, 384 officers in 2019, 442 officers in 2018, 531 officers in 2017 and 420 officers in 2016. These numbers prove the armed forces have no will to streamline their operation, with a view to efficiency and competency. If the armed forces are serious, they must set a definite timeline to put the plan into action and allow the public to follow up on its progress. A plan without action is just a dream, and in this case, a dream that could waste public funds."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,Opinion,Who wants a child amid such instability?,"A few weeks ago, the Ministry of Public Health launched a programme titled ""Life Balance Smart Family"" to pair singles and support soon-to-wed couples in childbearing. The policy came after Thailand was found to have the lowest total fertility rate in its history, dropping below 600,000 infant births for the first time last year. This has brought the birth rate down to 1.51, which is far below the World Health Organisation's recommendation of 2.1. Deputy Public Health Minister Sathit Pitutecha expressed concern because the country is becoming a full-fledged ageing society. He said the falling birth rate is a result of the growing number of single adults and couples who decide to postpone or eschew marriage completely. Meanwhile, others who tie the knot late suffer from infertility. For me, the programme doesn't hit the mark because it fails to address economic and political factors. Couples of reproductive age aren't having children because they feel insecure due to the lack of a support system. First, couples should have stable jobs to ensure good-quality child-rearing ability but the coronavirus outbreak has thrown workers into chaos with massive unemployment and furloughs. In January, the World Bank said the pandemic forced about 1.5 million Thais into poverty. The number of poor people was expected to increase from 3.7 million in 2019 to 5.2 million in 2020, however, it is expected to drop to 5 million this year because of job recovery. Who will shoulder extra financial burdens amid economic upheaval unless they have financial stability? Tax reduction for those who have legitimate children is nothing but a piecemeal effort because huge costs are required for child-raising. Besides pregnancy and delivery, tuition fees for 20 years (kindergarten to bachelor's degree) are estimated at 240,000 baht to 15 million baht, depending on the type and quality of schools. This harks back to the population control programme's slogan in 1972. At the time, the government came up with the catchphrase ""the more children, the greater the poverty"" to reduce the fertility rate from nearly 3 to 2. Moreover, couples are struggling to care for their elderly parents. Thailand is now a fully-fledged ageing society, with the number of aged people comprising a total of 13.1 million or 20% of the population. Filial piety is a key value in Thai society. My mother gives shelter and part of her salary to my grandmother. I don't go against fulfilling one's sense of filial duty but it should take into account the government's role in supporting grey citizens. Apart from saving plans, the government's welfare programme pays a monthly living allowance ranging from 600-1,000 baht, depending on age. In January, the House committee on state welfare said it would submit a draft law to change this into pension payment above the poverty line of 2,763 baht per month. However, I think this doesn't ease the financial burdens on breadwinners who are moving to find better job opportunities in Bangkok where the cost of living is high. In this scenario, who will dare to have children when they can't even stand on their own feet and support their parents? Another fundamental question is what kind of society do we want our children to live in? Thailand is under the guise of democracy. It has long been embroiled in political turmoil. Since the Siamese Revolution of 1932, we have seen more than 20 coups (one every four years). In 2014, the military took power from the civilian government on the pretext of bringing unity and stamping out corruption. Seven years have passed by but we haven't gone anywhere. For me, this stunts the growth of democracy which is meant to uphold equality and freedom. It is the political process where we have to learn to come together. Through elections, people can give power to their representatives or withdraw support when they don't fare well. It is the rule of thumb where we can make our voice heard. I don't want the younger generation to grow up in this suppressive environment. By having a democratically elected government, our children can benefit from well-crafted policies and dream of a better world. In my opinion, the government should instil hope into our children from the moment of birth. In Finland, the government has long handed out Kela maternity packages to families with newborns. These boxes carry baby clothes, soap, napkins and books. This is the symbol of the country's welfare system because every child will get this box no matter what. Meanwhile, our child welfare programme is not inclusive. Children from birth to six years of age are normally entitled to a 600 baht monthly living stipend to ensure their proper development. However, child protection advocates have called for expanding its programme to include all 4.2 million young children nationwide. The government also should increase existing incentives for couples, like paid maternity and paternity leave, childcare centres, and family funds. Otherwise, babies will only open their eyes to see Pandora's box. Thana Boonlert is a feature writer for the Life section of the Bangkok Post."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:00,Opinion,Mekong needs tough govt stance,"On Feb 8, Charge d'Affaires of Chinese Embassy Yang Xin paid a courtesy call to Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, in which they exchanged Chinese New Year's wishes, looking ahead for warmer relations and closer cooperation. One topic was missing from their friendly talks: the fluctuating water levels of the Mekong River which has been dry since last month largely because of equipment testing at Jinghong Dam. It's a missed opportunity. At the end of December, China had warned of lower water levels as it planned to reduce water discharges from its upstream Jinghong Dam in Yunnan from 1,900 to 1,000 cubic metres per second, starting on Jan 5. It's reported the equipment testing was due to end on Jan 24, but sources along the Thai-Lao border told Radio Free Asia earlier this month that water levels in their area have not returned to their normal levels. On Feb 12, the Mekong River Commission, an inter-governmental organisation made up of representatives of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, said water levels between China's Yunnan and Vietnam's Mekong Delta ""dropped considerably since the beginning of the year due to lower rainfall, flow changes upstream, hydropower operations in the Mekong tributaries, and outflow restrictions from Jinghong Dam"". It called the drops ""worrying"". ""Since the initial fall on Jan 1, outflow levels at Jinghong from 1 to 7 January were stable at 785 m³/s but gradually rose to 1,400 m³/s on 15 January, representing a 1.07-metre rise in the water level. The outflow then dropped to 740 m³/s during 15–23 January, before rising to 990 m³/s on 29 January. It then fell gradually, reaching 800 m³/s on Feb 11,"" it said. The MRC on Feb 22 said: ""According to MRC's observed water level data, the outflow at Jinghong hydrological station rose from 786 cubic metres per second (m³/s) on Monday last week to 1,020 m³/s today."" For years, people in the river basin have complained about the negative impact of upstream development projects in the Mekong. The river, with the Chinese name of Lancang, stretches about 4,900 kilometres from the Tibetan Plateau in China to Vietnam, and is being dotted with hydropower projects. Since the 1960s, China, Thailand and Laos have erected dozens of dams, and dozens more are being constructed. Rapids blasting to widen the waterways for large vessels by China is another factor contributing to adverse changes in the river ecology. These massive power-producing structures have choked the river of its natural resources. Fishermen in Thailand and Cambodia now say they can no longer profit from their trade because the fish population has dwindled. ""The water level is too low, and the climate is also changing,"" one Thai fisherman told German public broadcast service DW in a report published about a year ago. ""The water is lower than in other years. In the clear and shallow water, there are far fewer fish coming up the river."" ""I only catch 60% of what I used to catch,"" he added. The problem has gone on for years, and activists and government officials have repeatedly expressed concerns over the matter. In 2018, the MRC said hydropower development on the river will result in food insecurity and poverty in the region. Yet real action has not been taken to address the issue of fluctuating water levels in the Mekong River. China has agreed to work with the MRC to disclose when it will withhold water. However, the ongoing water crisis means that words are not enough. China knows full well that millions of people depend on the river for their livelihoods. The country said it believes cordial relations should do more to ease this crisis for Thailand and other downstream countries. The Thai government, at the same time, must listen to the civic groups, and make sure Beijing gets the message and restores the water flow. Gen Prayut cannot claim he is not informed about the Mekong crisis. In the past weeks, several media outlets have reported the issue. During the Feb 8 meeting with Mr Yang, Gen Prayut should have highlighted the plight of fishermen and farmers who rely on the natural resources provided by the Mekong River. The PM should have shown that he's on the side of Thailand by raising the issue with the envoy. At the same time, Beijing must understand that the Mekong River belongs to everyone living along the body of water. China has huge international ambitions, and it will need to convince many countries to hop on board its economic agendas. If it hopes to win the hearts and minds of the people of Indochina, Beijing must show that it is willing to be fair to people living outside of China."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:00,Opinion,A lesson in letting sleeping dogs lie,"As the mug-shot for this column might suggest, I do have a certain empathy for dogs and generally get on well with our furry friends. Maybe it's because I was born in the Year of the Dog. But you never know what is around the corner. Last week for the first time ever I was bitten by a dog. Hardly earth-shattering news, but it still came as a surprise. I should emphasise it was entirely my fault -- the dog was blameless. We were in Isan at the house of Thai relatives and were leaving just as dusk was falling. A combination of the fading light and my dodgy eyesight saw me misjudge the final step leading down from the house and I took a minor tumble. This in itself would not have been a problem, but unfortunately I landed on their dog, a rather large fellow with most impressive gnashers. Not surprisingly the hound, which had been minding its own business, enjoying a quiet snooze at the foot of the steps, thought it was being attacked by a crazy fat farang and in response reacted in the manner of any self-respecting Isan canine, taking a bite out of my leg. My relatives were full of apologies and blamed the dog, but I explained it was not Fido's fault. Fortunately I was wearing jeans which gave some protection, but still suffered a nasty-looking four-inch gash which meant an anti-rabies shot was required as soon as possible. I must thank the staff at the emergency room of the Tessaban Hospital in downtown Udon who treated me quickly in a friendly, efficient manner. Their good humour even had me leaving the place with bit of a spring in my step -- well, okay, a spring with a definite hint of a limp. Carry on nurse The treatment involves taking five separate shots of vaccine over a 28-day period which means in the past 10 days I have become a little too familiar with hospital emergency rooms in Udon, Chaiyaphum and Bangkok. The most memorable was in Khon San district of Chaiyaphum where at 8am I joined hundreds of outpatients in various states of distress, several on stretchers, waiting to be treated for assorted ailments. Once again I was hugely impressed by the overworked staff going about their demanding duties with a spiritual calmness I wish I possessed. The upside of the dog bite is that I've got to meet lots of nice nurses and doctors who despite their stressful work, somehow maintain a cheerful disposition. I felt a little guilty bothering them with my minor injury as they surely had far more important things to handle than look after the wretched Crutch. Taking the biscuit Postmen have the profession most associated with altercations with canines. A bite on the backside from hounds protecting their territory is almost a badge of honour among postal people and regarded simply as an occupational hazard. An English postman made headlines a few years ago for surviving his entire career without being bitten once. On every round he would stuff his pockets with biscuits and if any hound appeared to be a bit uppity he would toss them a couple of digestives and that would do the trick. Some time ago, after a Bangkok postman was badly bitten, it was revealed that Thai mailmen protected themselves by ""firing elastic bands at the dogs' noses"" to fend them off. This is not exactly hi-tech weaponry and apart from being sadly ineffective, one suspects that the ""elastic band defence"" would only irritate the dogs even more. Anyway, next time I visit the relatives, I might just have a few ginger nuts hidden away ""just in case''. But I will skip the elastic bands. Woof woof! While waiting for my shots in Khon San I noticed a poster featuring a cute puppy. It brought to mind the old music hall song Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me A Bow Wow, with its splendid chorus ""I've got a little cat, I'm very fond of that, but I'd rather have a bow wow wow."" I first heard it on BBC Radio's Children's Favourites in the 1950s but the earliest recording dates back to 1892 sung by Vesta Victoria. Among other luminaries that have recorded the Bow Wow song are the late Barbara Windsor, the unlikely pairing of Helen Mirren and Peter Sellers in the 1980 film The Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu, and the irresistible Miss Piggy.  Name game Thanks to readers responding to last week's item about aptonyms and coming up with a few gems they have personally experienced. The column mentioned a psychiatrist called Dr Dippy and I am delighted to hear from one Brit who as a kid was actually treated by a Dr Dippy whom he described as ""mad as a hatter"". Another reader had a psychiatrist with the splendid name of Dr Fears. Once again the legal profession proved fertile ground and there is currently a top legal firm in the English Midlands called Wright Hassall. I particularly liked the offering in an online comment which informed us of lawyers in the Irish town of Sligo called Argue & Phibbs. Another reader was amused to receive correspondence from Britain's Automobile Association signed by a Mrs Muststart, while a letter from a police station came from DC Cosham."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:00,Opinion,PDRC jailings reveal Ratsadorn's fate,"On the one hand, the Criminal Court's verdict on Wednesday, which threw core figures of the now-defunct People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) in jail for their role in the 2013-2014 protests, means a cabinet reshuffle is on the way. Particularly for the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP), the ruling is a political windfall for the faction led by Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwon who can now tighten his grip on the ruling party. On the other hand, the harsh verdict sent a strong message to the pro-democracy Ratsadorn group that their mission -- demanding reforms of the monarchy and the resignation of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha -- might land them in similar trouble. Although this court verdict can be appealed, it came as a shock given the strong connections between PDRC key figure Suthep Thaugsuban and Gen Prayut. It is an open secret that the group invited the military into politics. The fate of the PDRC heavyweights, despite their political prowess, is a surprise even to their rivals, such as members of pro-Thaksin Shinawatra groups. Even PDRC members must find it hard to believe that their role in overthrowing the Yingluck government over the shameful amnesty in 2013 would land them in prison. They were jailed on a range of charges, including insurrection, criminal association, illegal assembly and obstructing others from casting votes. Of the 26 PDRC leaders and associates, three facing jail terms are Digital Economy and Society Minister Buddhipongse Punnakanta (seven years), Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan (seven years and four months), both from the ruling PPRP, and Deputy Transport Minister Thaworn Senneam, from the Democrat Party (five years). The convictions have cost them their cabinet posts. Mr Nathapol, whose political rights were revoked automatically, lost his MP status, together with five other people, including his wife, Taya, who previously declared herself as a candidate for the upcoming Bangkok governor election. Mr Suthep was sentenced to five years; Chumpol Julasai, a Democrat MP for Chumphon, 11 years; and Democrat list-MP Isara Somchai, eight years and four months. The ruling proves that the relationship with the powers-that-be that they used to enjoy is no longer intact. After the verdict was issued, the phrase set na kaa ko thuek, set suek kaa khunpon, meaning once the job is done, those on duty become useless and can be got rid of, resonated on social media. Such a message also seems to apply to the Ratsadorn group -- and they should learn from the lesson given to the PDRC. In fact, jail terms have been handed down to all those involved in street politics, no matter what colour they were associated with. Yellow-shirt leaders, once considered elite mobsters, who spearheaded the campaign against Thaksin in the early 2000s, also found themselves in jail over the seizure of Government House, NBT station and other state offices. The court ordered them to jointly pay 522 million baht in compensation for seizing and occupying Suvarnabhumi airport, while criminal charges are being considered. The 12 red-shirt leaders who protested in 2010 against the Abhisit Vejjajiva administration were consigned to a similar fate. The Supreme Court handed down four-year jail terms to those involved in the Asean summit fiasco; two year and eight month terms for the chaos in front of the residence of Gen Prem Tinsulanonda, then president of the Privy Council, and two- to 33-year terms for the arson at Ubon Ratchathani provincial hall. The Criminal Court, however, acquitted the defendants of treason and terrorism charges for the attack at Kok Wua intersection that killed Gen Romklao Thuwatham, an officer who, with his unit, tried to retake the area from protesters. Over the past decades, the country has been trapped in a cycle of political conflict, leading to many deaths and injuries, as polarisation has deepened. Some protest leaders have been jailed; others sought exile abroad. Quite a few repented for what they had done, which inadvertently paved the way for Ta Yoo, a fictitious figure who as an opportunist reaps ill-gotten benefits from disputes, to cling on to power unjustifiably. And now there seems there will be no end to the political conflict now the Ratsadorn group has emerged with their ambitious goals. However, the Ratsadorn group could face the same -- or an even more serious fate. Nearly 100 have been charged with Section 112 and Section 116 for sedition while some have been accused of aiming to hurt Her Majesty the Queen, a crime under Section 110. All of these charges carry heavy penalties. The movement has experienced its own crisis. Four key leaders, including Parit Chiwarak and Arnon Nampa, have been detained after the court turned down their bail requests for the fourth time, citing concerns over repeat offences. More are to be charged. There are also reports of an internal rift between its young leaders. Some have apparently resorted to mud-slinging tactics against each other. Even if they try to blame a third party, the debacle has weakened the movement and after a vigorous start with many thousand young people attending their rallies, the number of demonstrators declined precipitously following a series of violent episodes. Not to mention the fact that they implemented the wrong strategy by solely targeting reforms of the high institution, instead of attacking Gen Prayut and his flaws in running the country. With their power wilting, the movement has lost its bargaining strength. That's why the demand for bail for the four leaders has been denied, unlike previous times. Whether or not the young people can once again gather in large numbers depends on whether the government makes a mistake. In short, this may happen only if the government shoots itself in the foot. Will the pro-democracy movement come to an end? What will their fate be after this difficult time? They will likely have to undergo legal troubles just like the former PDRC members. The young fighters will eventually have to swallow the bitter pill that only charter amendment can be achieved."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:00,Opinion,Promote police fairly,"Even though Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha and his government survived the Feb 16-19 no-confidence motion, there are a number of debate issues that pose questions about his leadership and his sincerity towards solving such matters. Among them is a recent case that's come to light -- the promotion of senior police officers through a ticketing system that has been riddled with irregularities and nepotism. The promotion issue was raised by the Move Forward Party (MFP) MP Rangsiman Rome during the censure debate on Feb 19, the last day of the four-day session. The opposition politician mentioned long-standing issues within the police, including corruption and position buying as well as certain favours through what he called tua chang, or ""elephant tickets"". This is a fast-track promotion system where people, including the undeserving, avoid having to meet the criteria needed to earn promotion. Mr Rangsiman particularly questioned the promotion of Pol Lt Gen Torsak Sukwimol, head of the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB), whom he said had managed to quickly climb up the police ladder with a few exemptions. He said such exemptions paving the way for the CIB boss to reach the top position, disheartens and damages the morale of other officers. The opposition politician lambasted Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, who is chairman of the Police Commission, for allowing such irregularities to occur under his watch. Such malpractice had existed when Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon was overseeing police affairs. During the Feb 19 debate, the opposition politician was interrupted several times and eventually asked by the House Speaker to stop talking as he began making references to the monarchy. He duly complied. The politician later held a press conference where he provided more details to support his allegations. More than a week after the debate wrapped up, Gen Prayut has failed to give a satisfactory response to the opposition politician's allegations. This is disappointing. On Feb 22, the prime minister admitted that there were problems within the police force and he would tackle it. Such a statement is too vague and perhaps was made to hide the fact that nothing will actually be done, as has been the case in other scandals. It should be noted that Gen Prayut could not hide his irritation over the leakage of the documents referring to the elephant tickets which he said ""should not have happened"". But without such leaks, how can the public be sure the problem will be properly dealt with? How long will such malpractices continue under the prime minister's supervision? How many promises has the prime minister made when it comes to improving the police service -- promises that have yet to be turned into action? Mr Rangsiman's tua chang allegations have garnered enormous public attention, with over 1.7 million tweets. The controversy comes at a time when the police's reputation is already severely damaged following a series of other scandals that have not been addressed. These mostly have to do with police involvement in the operating of illegal casinos in several provinces that have been blamed for Thailand's second Covid-19 wave. These allegations also came at the right time, because just a few days after the debate, parliament passed the police reform bill in its second reading. Those now involved in scrutinising the bill before the third reading should be responsive to public input as the government is clearly not up to the task."
23-ก.พ.-21,8:45,Auto,Cherokee Nation asks Jeep to 'retire' name of SUV,"WASHINGTON: The Cherokee Nation said Monday it has asked for its tribal name to be removed as a nameplate from Jeep sport utility vehicles and called for a dialogue with the automaker on ""cultural appropriateness"". The Native American group's principal chief Chuck Hoskin Jr asked Jeep's parent firm Stellantis ""he does not condone"" the use of the name Cherokee on the vehicles, according to a statement. Hoskin made the comments last month in response to an inquiry from Car & Driver and subsequently held a Zoom call with representatives of the automaker who had contacted him, the group said. ""I think we're in a day and age in this country where it's time for both corporations and team sports to retire the use of Native American names, images and mascots from their products, team jerseys and sports in general,"" Hoskin said in his initial statement. ""I'm sure this comes from a place that is well-intended, but it does not honour us by having our name plastered on the side of a car. ""The best way to honour us is to learn about our sovereign government, our role in this country, our history, culture and language and have meaningful dialogue with federally recognised tribes on cultural appropriateness.""The news comes with growing momentum to remove Native American names and images from sports teams in the United States, which many now see as demeaning to the indigenous peoples. Stellantis, the new name for Jeep's corporate parent following the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jeep has been using the Cherokee name since the 1970s but stopped using it for several years before reviving it in 2013."
23-ก.พ.-21,6:22,Auto,Domestic car sales slump,"Domestic car sales in Thailand declined 21.3% in January to 55,208 units from last year as the second-wave outbreak continues to drag down consumer confidence and purchasing power. Passenger car sales decreased by 44.2% to 16,104 units year-on-year, while sales of commercial cars decreased 5.4% to 39,104 units. Pure pickups with 1 tonne size loads and pickup passenger vehicles dropped by 9.6% year-on-year to 30,107 units. Surasak Suthongwan, vice-president of Toyota Motor Thailand, said customers are concerned the new wave of the pandemic will greatly affect the economy, businesses and job prospects, so potential buyers are avoiding purchases. Whole sectors that employ local people, such as the tourism industry, are practically on standby, while the automotive industry has yet to recover from last year's contraction. ""Those factors caused domestic car sales to drop and the company is closely monitoring the economic situation and the pandemic,"" he said. In January, Toyota's domestic car sales were 17,758 units or a decrease of 12.2% year-on-year. Toyota has a 32.2% market share in Thailand. The company expects domestic car sales in February will continue to be affected by the pandemic. Toyota expects the government's stimulus measures will relieve the economy and help boost consumer spending."
22-ก.พ.-21,6:20,Auto,Car manufacturers in race to bag chips,"Domestic car manufacturers are racing to increase purchase orders for semiconductors to avoid cutting their production capacity as a result of a global shortage of chips for cars. Representing the control centre of modern cars and electrical appliances, these semiconductors are now in short supply, intensifying the competition to obtain them. The global chip shortage results from a combination of factors ranging from increasing demand for electronic equipment as more people work from home during the pandemic, the growth in electric vehicles, as well as the US-China trade war, which led to restrictions on chip imports from China. ""The automotive industry is concerned it will encounter a similar situation as the one that took place in the US as chip supplies in Thailand have nearly run out,"" said Suparat Sirisuwanangkura, vice-chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries' (FTI) economic and academic data analytics unit. Some car manufacturers in the US have already shut down or reduced their production, according to the FTI. Mr Suparat said automakers in Thailand are in talks with chip producers, requesting they increase their production capacity to meet the rapid growth in demand. The chip shortage comes as importers and exporters are struggling to deal with a lack of containers. The problem is especially vexing for companies producing electrical appliances, said FTI vice-chairwoman Kanit Muangkrachang, who also chairs the FTI's Electrical, Electronics, Telecommunications and Allied Industry Club. The semiconductor shortage means more delays in the delivery time for microchips, which has risen from four to six months, according to the club. Ms Kanit expects the chip shortage will only cause a short-term impact because chip manufacturers will eventually increase their production capacity. The other serious problem concerning container shortages at major ports requires urgent solutions as it not only causes shipping delays but also increases freight rates. ""Thai exporters are seeing their costs triple,"" she said. ""Large firms may manage to handle the burden, but small and medium-sized companies cannot afford to pay the additional expense."""

From January to December last year, Mercedes Benz recorded a total of 10,613 deliveries in the Thai market, a 30% decrease from 15,158 units sold in 2019, but it managed to deliver more than 2 million cars globally for the fifth consecutive year, with sales of 2,528,349 units. ""Even with the uncontrollable challenges from Covid-19, we have seen positive signs from our customers around the world,"" Mercedes-Benz (Thailand) president and chief executive Roland Folger said on Thursday as the company unveiled its 2020 business performance. The unprecedented recovery in China led to sales growth of 11.7% that drove up sales in Asia-Pacific region by 4.7%. In Thailand, despite the two outbreaks, the company ""get through the year well,"" said Mr Folger, believing the luxury car market will remain a driving force for the global and local economy. Sales of Mercedes-AMG increased by 33.9% while Mercedes-Benz V-Class soared by 59.2% last year. ""Mercedes-AMG is a brand for performance cars that can be used daily, so customers chose AMG brand above other models,"" Mr Folger told the Bangkok Post. The company also started local production of AMG, making its prices become more affordable. It is preparing to launch a compact vehicle version of AMG at a price of three million baht. In a luxury van segment, known as V-Class, its sales surge resulted from efforts to ""promote our models progressively throughout the year,"" said Mr Folger. Digital marketing also helped Mercedes-Benz bolster its online sales. In 2020, it started the new sales channel with GLB 200 Progressive model.

The Oil Fuel Fund Administration Office (Offo), which subsidises gasohol and biodiesel, found prices of ethanol and palm oil-made methyl ester have increased for many years, exceeding even those for pure gasoline and diesel. Officials want E20, a mix of 20% ethanol and 80% unleaded gasoline 95, to replace gasohol 91, making gasohol 95 an alternative fuel for drivers. Yet the plan has faced several delays. Gasohol 91 and 95 have a 10% ethanol blend. They differ in their octane rating numbers. Permanent energy secretary Kulit Sombatsiri said biofuels have lost their competitiveness in terms of production costs. The reference price of ethanol, which is made from sugar and cassava, stood at 24.83 baht a litre on Feb 12, compared with 13.83 baht a litre for the ex-refinery price of gasoline 95. The methyl ester reference price was 42.83 baht per litre, compared with 15.5 baht per litre of high-speed diesel, excluding tax and levy. According to Offo, the subsidy for gasohol E20 was 2.28 baht a litre last Thursday. The subsidy for gasohol E85 was 7.13 baht a litre and the subsidy for biodiesel B20 was 4.16 baht a litre. E85 is an 85% ethanol blend, while B20 is a mix of 20% methyl ester and 80% diesel. ""We have to delay the E20 plan until biofuel costs decline, with their demand and supply in balance so they do not affect the Oil Fuel Fund,"" said Mr Kulit. E20 was launched as an alternative fuel in January 2008 when the globaloil price rose to US$100 per barrel. Officials support use of E20 because they want to see sugar cane and cassava planters play an increasing role in the domestic oil market. The government also wants to increase the prices of agricultural commodities such as sugar, cassava and palm oil by using them as biofuels. Under the Offo Act, subsidies for biofuels must be capped and terminate within seven years after 2019. The plan to make E20 the primary petrol faced several delays in 2020 because the government needed ethanol to make hand sanitisers when Covid-19 hit Thailand."
9-ก.พ.-21,13:45,Auto,Govt targets 30% electric-car production to tackle pollution,"Thailand will target having electric vehicles account for 30% of car production by the end of the decade, as part of efforts to tackle toxic air pollution. The government wants to “accelerate the use and production of electric vehicles, with national strategies focusing on the environment and air pollution solutions,” Industry Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit said in an interview. Thailand already has an advantage by being a car-production hub and it’s now time to focus on EVs, he said. While the overall contribution from vehicles to pollution is much smaller than other sources like crop burning or forest fires, a survey commissioned by Nissan Motor Co showed that 91% of Thais would buy an EV because of the environmental impact. The survey found 43% of Thai non-EV owners would consider an EV for their next car purchase within the next three years. Some of the measures to stimulate the domestic market and achieve the 2030 goal include encouraging the use of electric vehicles by state agencies, tax benefits and parking discounts for buyers, more investment incentives for companies, and developing charging infrastructure across the country, Mr Suriya said. The 30% target will include cars, motorbikes and buses, he added. Such initiatives would support continued growth of EV sales in Thailand, Allen Abraham, an analyst at BloombergNEF, wrote in a Feb 4 report. While the Thai EV market is still small, it showed “great resilience” last year despite the pandemic denting overall auto sales, Abraham said. EV car sales increased 1.4% in 2020, while regular auto sales slumped 26%.The Board of Investment has already granted EV privileges to more than a dozen companies, including Nissan, Toyota Motor Corp, Mercedes-Benz AG, BMW AG, and Energy Absolute Plc’s Mine Mobility. In November, the government approved new incentives to boost production of EVs and its supply chain, including a three-year tax holiday for manufacturers of plug-in hybrid vehicles, and an eight-year corporate income tax waiver for battery electric vehicle makers."
8-ก.พ.-21,5:55,Auto,Campaigns aim to ease auto loan stress,"Auto loan providers have launched new debt restructuring packages to control non-performing loans (NPLs) after forecasting higher bad debts in the first quarter due to the impact of the pandemic. Tisco Bank, the country's leading automotive lender, introduced a debt pay-off campaign for customers purchasing commercial vans, who largely operate in tourism-related businesses and have been battered by the pandemic. The bank launched the campaign late last year for businesses operating tour vans, which are considered on a case-by-case basis, said president and chief operating officer Sakchai Peechapat. The solution is a financial instrument to help customers who cannot service their debts to close their loan accounts and maintain a good credit record with the National Credit Bureau. Instalments for borrowers average between 15,000-25,000 baht per month. Given the prolonged tourism slowdown, most tourism service operators are unable to generate any income, which reduces their ability to repay their debt. Around 200 customers applied for the debt pay-off campaign over the past two months, he said. ""The campaign is beyond a normal debt restructuring programme. With a targeted measure focusing on hard-hit customers, it should help them during this difficult situation,"" said Mr Sakchai. In December 2020, Tisco Bank's total outstanding auto loans stood at 127 billion baht, representing 57% of its total loan portfolio. Around 25% of all auto loan customers applied for the first-phase debt restructuring measure, and most of them managed to exit the programme following its expiry in October 2020. Approved by the Bank of Thailand, the debt restructuring programme has been extended until June 2021 on a case-by-case basis. Mr Sakchai expects around 10% of auto loan clients to apply for the bank's second-phase debt restructuring programme after a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections emerged late last year. The reduction in the number of applications for debt restructuring is related to the government's moderate measures aimed at containing the latest outbreak, he said. However, auto NPLs are expected to edge up during this quarter because of a delay following the expiry of the first phase of the debt relief programme, said Mr Sakchai. With this debt campaign, Tisco Bank aims to control bad debt this year in the auto loan segment at no higher than its existing level of 2.5%. The bank is paying closer attention to asset quality than loan growth, anticipating total auto loan growth of 2-3% this year, he said. For new loan bookings, the bank is targeting a 10-15% growth rate as it forecasts domestic new car sales at around 800,000 units this year. Other major players in the domestic auto loan segment have also rolled out relief measures to aid customers affected by the pandemic. Krungsri Auto, a car loan unit under Bank of Ayudhya, has reduced instalments by up to 30% from the original level. For customers living within maximum control zones, based on the government's classification, the company provides a maximum three-month grace period for both principal and interest payments for motorcycle loans, and a three-month grace period for principal payments on car loans. Krungsri Auto is also offering debt relief options on a case-by-case basis to assist hard-hit customers. Philip Chen Chong Tan, president of Kiatnakin Phatra Bank (KKP), said the bank continues to provide financial assistance to auto loan borrowers on a case-by-case basis, and has extended help for clients to exit its debt restructuring programme. Under a selective strategy, KKP has set its auto loan growth target at 5% in 2021, compared with an aggressive growth target of 18% last year."
5-ก.พ.-21,8:45,Auto,"Ford to speed up push to electric autos, digitisation","NEW YORK - Ford announced Thursday a dramatic acceleration of its investment push into electric autos and signaled deepening collaborations with technology giants on the increased digitisation of driving. The US auto giant, released fourth-quarter and annual results, and said it plans $22 billion in electric car investment through 2025, nearly twice the earlier plan. The announcement is the latest big bet on electric autos by a legacy automaker in the wake of upstart Tesla's growth and in anticipation of Biden administration initiatives to encourage emission-free vehicles. Last week, Ford's rival General Motors set a target of having most of its fleet emissions-free by 2035. ""It's stunning how fast the industry is changing,"" said Chief Executive Jim Farley who pointed to surging electric auto sales in Europe. Farley reported strong early interest in Ford's Mustang Mach-E, its electric sport utility vehicle which hit showrooms in December. The automaker plans a range of all-electric vehicles, including for its best-selling F-150 pickup truck. ""The costs are coming down quickly, but for me and the team, the move to electric is not about batteries and motors,"" Farley said on a conference call with analysts. ""It's about a digital vehicle and a new customers experience."" The revamped plan came as Ford reported a fourth-quarter loss of $2.8 billion, compared with a loss of $1.7 billion in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 9.3% to $36 billion. Ford projected 2021 operating profits of $8 to $9 billion, much above $2.8 billion in 2020, when the company suffered a big drop in auto sales amid the disruption from Covid-19. Hit from semiconductor crunch Ford on Monday unveiled an alliance with Google to employ its cloud computing platform. Farley said the Google venture is not ""exclusive"" and that Ford's vehicles would also employ Amazon's voice program and other programs by Apple and Microsoft. ""The technology partners are becoming more and more important for us to deliver the digital experience,"" he said. Farley said the auto giant planned to take steps to lock in capacity of electric battery cells, recognizing that supplies could be challenged as more rivals build electric cars. The auto industry is today facing a shortage of semiconductors following a surging demand for chips over the last year from customer electronics. Ford projected annual operating profits could be dented by $1 to $2.5 billion due to lost auto sales connected to the semiconductor shortage. Earlier Thursday, Ford said it was trimming output of its F-150 because of the supply issue, following on the heels of other automakers, including GM that announced Tuesday it was shutting productions at three plants, and slashing output in half at another due to chip supply. ""We want to lock it up,"" Farley said of battery cell capacity. ""We cannot afford to be in the situation we are with the semiconductors right now."" Ford shares rose 1.2% in after-hours trading to $11.51."
27-ม.ค.-21,4:00,Auto,Retest senior drivers for road safety,"Should senior drivers holding lifetime driving licences have a retest to see if they are still fit to drive? Common sense says yes. But when the idea to retest senior drivers over 70 was floated, it was immediately attacked and subsequently dropped. Should it, really? Thailand's road accidents are among the highest in the world. How long can our rapidly ageing country postpone a policy to protect not only other people on the road but also the senior drivers themselves? To be fair, many questions arose when the proposal to retest senior drivers over 70 emerged. For example, why 70? Are there any solid studies showing people over 70 cause more road accidents than those under 70? Shouldn't the retest be based on senior drivers' health conditions, not a specific age group? Apart from the number of road accidents among drivers over 70, we also need to know the exact number of senior drivers with lifetime driving licences to calculate if it is worthwhile to issue new rules and regulations. Lifetime driving licences were the order of the day when the Registration Division of the then Police Department was in charge of road safety. Their limited personnel could not cope with a large number of drivers, so they issued lifetime driving licences to reduce the workload. It was replaced by the current system in 1988 when the issuing of driving licences became the responsibility of the Department of Land Transport. In 2003, the Motor Vehicle Act officially abrogated lifetime driving licences but allowed those issued before October 2003 to remain effective. If the drivers who received the last batch of lifetime driving licences were 20 in 2003, they are now 36 years old. Given the average lifespan of Thai people, it is estimated that lifetime driving licences will be around for at least 35-40 years from now. According to the Department of Land Transport, there were about 12 million lifetime driving licences in the country as of 2003. This figure might not be accurate. Since 2004, the reported number of lifetime driving licences has been higher than that. Questions then arose if the Land Transport Department has updated its database to establish the exact number of licences in the country. To avoid ageism, we need to know if older drivers really cause more road accidents because of age-related health problems. According to the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, the number of road deaths are highest in the 15-24 and 50-80 age groups. Although the figures do not show correlations between ages and accidents, old age undeniably produces health problems that may affect driving ability. A study on driving licences system development by Kasetsart University has pointed out that declining health conditions can increase the risks of accidents. For example, sudden unconsciousness, muscle weakness, bone diseases, and disorders of the nervous system. Since older people are susceptible to these symptoms due to declining health, old age may indeed contribute to higher road accidents and casualties among drivers over 50. It is useful to take a look at other countries' measures for retesting senior drivers in their driver licensing systems. In the European Union, drivers are required to have a retest to ensure their driving ability when they reach a specified age. In Sweden, drivers must have a retest when they are 45 and again every 10 years after that. In France, the retest is mandatory when the drivers reach 60, and again every two or five years after that. Although Australia does not specify the age for a retest, it has special measures for drivers over 75, requiring them to have medical examinations to ensure they are in good health in accordance with state rules and regulations. They also need to have medical certificates showing they are fit to drive. Policies must be based on sound and comprehensive information. Whether or not to retest or to revoke lifetime driving licences then depends significantly on the accurate number of lifetime driving licences and road accidents among senior drivers. Providing an accurate database is the responsibility of the Department of Land Transport. Accuracy can be achieved by linking the database of drivers holding lifetime licences with the information in the civil registration system run by the Department of Provincial Administration. Linking the two systems will show the drivers' current status as well as ascertain the existing number of people who hold lifetime driving licences. If the number of senior drivers with lifetime licences is very small compared to the total number of drivers and road accidents, then there will be no need to renew or revoke their driving licences. The cost-effective measure is to wait until those driving licences expire when the owners pass away. But if the number of senior drivers with lifetime driving licences is substantial and affects road safety, then the government must consider renewing the licences. Between public safety and private citizens' rights, public safety must be the priority. Should the government decide to revoke or renew lifetime driving licences, it must amend the Motor Vehicle Act by specifying the age of senior drivers whose driving licences need to be revoked. We recommend they should be in the 60-70 age group. Should senior drivers want to continue driving, they must take a retest to show that they are still fit to drive before receiving a regular five-year driving licence. The retest criteria or measures should be clarified in the ministerial regulations or the operators' rule books. The debate on the need to retest senior drivers is not new. It resurfaces every time there are efforts to address the issue of senior drivers and road safety. Effective measures can protect senior drivers and increase road safety. Making every driver operate under the same standard rules will strengthen international confidence in Thailand's measures on road safety. Hopefully, this can improve Thailand's tattered image as one of the world's most dangerous places to drive.

28-ม.ค.-21,4:00,Auto,Toyota sees a 'bright future' from 2021,"Toyota Motor Thailand expects a ""bright future"" for the Thai automotive industry may begin in 2021 though the year started with a new Covid-19 outbreak as the Japanese car maker sets an ambitious target of 15-23% growth in sales, with its environmentally-friendly campaign to play an important role in stimulating new purchases. Among its marketing plans is a move to awaken prospective buyers to all types of electric vehicles -- battery electric vehicles (BEV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) -- all of which, together with other efforts to reduce pollution, will help Toyota complete its goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 90%, compared with the level in 2010, said Toyota Motor Thailand president Noriaki Yamashita, referring to Toyota's 2050 environmental commitment. ""We expect a bright future will start from now on,"" Mr Yamashita said, lauding the government for its control of the Covid-19 spread last year which dented domestic car sales during the lockdown period. Though the virus has come back, ""we believe situation will be getting better,"" he said. Like major car manufacturers, Toyota saw its 2020 sales dive by 26.5% to 244,316 units from 2019. Exports last year also dropped by 18.7% to 215,277 units year-on-year. It managed to command a 30.8% market share, the highest in total car sales, due mainly to its introduction of new models. With the pandemic situation expected to calm down, Mr Yamashita is optimistic about sales in 2021. The company expects to sell between 280,000 and 300,000, a 15-23% growth, with exports believed to increase by 18% to 254,000 units, from 2020. Total car sales in the country should increase by 7-14% to 850,000–900,000 units in 2021, it said. To strengthen its environmental protection efforts, Mr Yamashita said, it is working with allies to better manage used batteries from EVs under the 3R (reuse, rebuild, and recycle) scheme."
1-มี.ค.-21,20:16,Life,"Netflix, Disney win big at Golden Globes","Netflix and Walt Disney emerged as the big winners at the Golden Globe awards, taking home most of the evening’s prizes for their films and television shows, in an awards show tailor-made for the unusual pandemic-affected times. Disney grabbed the top award, best dramatic motion picture, for Nomadland, while the film’s director Chloe Zhao became the second-ever woman to take home that prize. Netflix especially dominated in television, with The Crown and The Queen’s Gambit, grabbing a handful of awards at the ceremony. In all, the two studios won 15 of the prizes handed out Sunday by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in a NBC broadcast hosted by comic actors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. The dominance of the top global streaming service and the top traditional studio won’t surprise many. For the past year, many theaters have been closed, and the biggest new films have been delayed or put online. That also meant studios had to hold back at least some of their multi-million-dollar marketing budgets, making it harder to suss out clear favourites. Instead, online viewing was on the rise, with even Disney leaning hard into the change, expanding its Disney+ streaming service and debuting top films over the internet. Netflix shares were up 1.1% to $544.50 and Disney was up 1.7% to $192.30 in premarket trading at 7.57am Monday in New York. Other streaming services, particularly Amazon.com, also picked up key prizes. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm won best picture, musical or comedy, and its star Sacha Baron Cohen won the Golden Globe for his performance. Other winners included Daniel Kaluuya, who was named best supporting actor in a motion picture for his role in Judas and the Black Messiah, a Warner Bros film about the FBI’s infiltration of the Black Panthers. John Boyega was voted best supporting actor in a TV role for his part in Small Axe, an Amazon show about London’s West Indian community, and Schitt’s Creek captured the award for best TV comedy. Because of Covid-19, the 78th Golden Globes were held with presenters and winners appearing remotely, unlike past years, when the awards were handed out in a banquet room at the Beverly Hilton hotel before a TV audience of millions. They’re also usually held in January, when many awards contenders are still playing in theaters. An opening monologue from comedians Fey and Poehler highlighted the oddity. Rather than sharing the stage at the Hilton, they spoke from separate stages there and at the Rainbow Room in New York. 78th Golden Globe Awards: Winners & Nominees “Normally this room is full of celebrities, but tonight our audience on both coasts is made of smoking-hot first responders,” Fey said. “We are so grateful for the work that you do, and that you’re here, so that the celebrities can stay safely at home.” The picture has been much brighter for TV, which the Globes also celebrate. Millions of people stuck at home in the U.S. and abroad over the past year swarmed to streaming services like Netflix and Disney+, which now count hundreds of millions of subscribers globally. In addition to winning best television drama, Netflix’s British royal chronicle The Crown, saw the actors who played Princess Diana and Prince Charles, Emma Corrin and Josh O’Connor, both take home acting awards. Gillian Anderson won a supporting Golden Globe for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in the series. With film nominees like Mank and popular series like The Crown, Netflix led the nominations with 42. Disney was second with 20, including a best-picture nod for the movie Nomadland and its star Frances McDormand. The year’s awards also come against the backdrop of controversy surrounding the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group of journalists that chooses the nominees and winners. A lawsuit filed by a Norwegian journalist who was denied membership accused the organization of corruption, laid out in a series of exposes by the Los Angeles Times. The suit was dismissed, but several members told the newspaper awards can effectively be “bought” with expensive press junkets, among other inappropriate behaviour. The group has also been criticised for failing to have a Black member for at least 20 years and for overlooking some of the buzziest Black-led pictures this year with their film-drama nominations. Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom and Da 5 Bloods are expected to be nominated for best picture at this year’s Academy Awards, according to the website Gold Derby. The Oscar nominations come out on March 15. The HFPA told the newspaper that none of the allegations had been proven in court, and they reflected “unconscious bias” against its “diverse membership.” Even with pandemic, the Golden Globes remain a big marketing showcase. Last year’s telecast drew a US TV audience of 18.3 million viewers, putting it among the most-watched nonsports shows of the year. The Oscars, the movie industry’s most-prestigious awards, drew an audience of 24.3 million."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,Life,Who wants a child amid such instability?,"A few weeks ago, the Ministry of Public Health launched a programme titled ""Life Balance Smart Family"" to pair singles and support soon-to-wed couples in childbearing. The policy came after Thailand was found to have the lowest total fertility rate in its history, dropping below 600,000 infant births for the first time last year. This has brought the birth rate down to 1.51, which is far below the World Health Organisation's recommendation of 2.1. Deputy Public Health Minister Sathit Pitutecha expressed concern because the country is becoming a full-fledged ageing society. He said the falling birth rate is a result of the growing number of single adults and couples who decide to postpone or eschew marriage completely. Meanwhile, others who tie the knot late suffer from infertility. For me, the programme doesn't hit the mark because it fails to address economic and political factors. Couples of reproductive age aren't having children because they feel insecure due to the lack of a support system. First, couples should have stable jobs to ensure good-quality child-rearing ability but the coronavirus outbreak has thrown workers into chaos with massive unemployment and furloughs. In January, the World Bank said the pandemic forced about 1.5 million Thais into poverty. The number of poor people was expected to increase from 3.7 million in 2019 to 5.2 million in 2020, however, it is expected to drop to 5 million this year because of job recovery. Who will shoulder extra financial burdens amid economic upheaval unless they have financial stability? Tax reduction for those who have legitimate children is nothing but a piecemeal effort because huge costs are required for child-raising. Besides pregnancy and delivery, tuition fees for 20 years (kindergarten to bachelor's degree) are estimated at 240,000 baht to 15 million baht, depending on the type and quality of schools. This harks back to the population control programme's slogan in 1972. At the time, the government came up with the catchphrase ""the more children, the greater the poverty"" to reduce the fertility rate from nearly 3 to 2. Moreover, couples are struggling to care for their elderly parents. Thailand is now a fully-fledged ageing society, with the number of aged people comprising a total of 13.1 million or 20% of the population. Filial piety is a key value in Thai society. My mother gives shelter and part of her salary to my grandmother. I don't go against fulfilling one's sense of filial duty but it should take into account the government's role in supporting grey citizens. Apart from saving plans, the government's welfare programme pays a monthly living allowance ranging from 600-1,000 baht, depending on age. In January, the House committee on state welfare said it would submit a draft law to change this into pension payment above the poverty line of 2,763 baht per month. However, I think this doesn't ease the financial burdens on breadwinners who are moving to find better job opportunities in Bangkok where the cost of living is high. In this scenario, who will dare to have children when they can't even stand on their own feet and support their parents? Another fundamental question is what kind of society do we want our children to live in? Thailand is under the guise of democracy. It has long been embroiled in political turmoil. Since the Siamese Revolution of 1932, we have seen more than 20 coups (one every four years). In 2014, the military took power from the civilian government on the pretext of bringing unity and stamping out corruption. Seven years have passed by but we haven't gone anywhere. For me, this stunts the growth of democracy which is meant to uphold equality and freedom. It is the political process where we have to learn to come together. Through elections, people can give power to their representatives or withdraw support when they don't fare well. It is the rule of thumb where we can make our voice heard. I don't want the younger generation to grow up in this suppressive environment. By having a democratically elected government, our children can benefit from well-crafted policies and dream of a better world. In my opinion, the government should instil hope into our children from the moment of birth. In Finland, the government has long handed out Kela maternity packages to families with newborns. These boxes carry baby clothes, soap, napkins and books. This is the symbol of the country's welfare system because every child will get this box no matter what. Meanwhile, our child welfare programme is not inclusive. Children from birth to six years of age are normally entitled to a 600 baht monthly living stipend to ensure their proper development. However, child protection advocates have called for expanding its programme to include all 4.2 million young children nationwide. The government also should increase existing incentives for couples, like paid maternity and paternity leave, childcare centres, and family funds. Otherwise, babies will only open their eyes to see Pandora's box. Thana Boonlert is a feature writer for the Life section of the Bangkok Post."

By ARUSA PISUTHIPAN You have to see Her Royal Highness Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana Rajakanya work to understand why everything she is passionate about -- be it classical music, equestrianism or fashion -- all turns out to be a great achievement. With her determination to transform her creativity into reality, her passion into a work of art and to bring Thailand to the forefront in classical music, equestrianism and fashion, Princess Sirivannavari is this year chosen as one of Thailand's most recognisable woman leaders and role models in the Bangkok Post's first Women of the Year campaign, set up with an objective to promote gender equality as well as to praise and honour successful women in various fields. ""To become an artist, one needs to go through lots of training and hard work. One needs to keep their eyes wide open and to be knowledgeable in various art forms,"" said Princess Sirivannavari. The youngest daughter of HM King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajira­klaochaoyuhua, the Princess' passion in art and design has long been evident. To her, music and fashion -- two different art genres -- can coexist and should in fact complement one another. As a patron of the Royal Bangkok Symphony Orchestra (RBSO), Princess Sirivannavari has since 2016 bestowed an opportunity for the RBSO to perform her compositions at her fashion shows. Unique to each of her fashion collections, the Princess always selects a special musical instrument to suit the collection she designs, while still maintaining the use of electric instruments of which she is particularly fond. To date, the Princess has composed six songs for the RBSO which includes Nefreretta, a new royal composition to be performed at her upcoming fashion show for the Sirivannavari Spring/Summer 2021 collection later this month. (March 18) In 2019, as part of the celebrations for the coronation of HM King Maha Vajiralongkorn Phra Vajiraklaochaoyuhua, Princess Sirivannavari composed four special songs which were played by the RBSO -- for which the Princess herself also serves as director and the chair of the Artistic Committee -- in the ""Four Royal Orchestral Suites For His Majesty King Rama X"" concert that took place at the National Theatre. Their Majesties the King and Queen together with HRH Princess Bajrakitiyabha Narendiradebyavati graciously attended the concert. Prior to the concert, the Princess worked tirelessly with all members of the orchestra at every rehearsal to ensure everything was nothing but a perfection. ""An artist or designer should be aware of how to work with other people, how to survive and earn a living. It is also paramount that they have ideas that can be developed further and that they know how to make the young generation realise the importance of harmony,"" said the Princess. ""I have a vision to make the RBSO one of the leading orchestras in Asia Pacific. I wish to develop the talent of Thai classical musicians to match the international standard so that they are eligible to go on a world tour. The RBSO must be recognised by the international communities, where we must be able to make fame outside Thailand with pride and dignity."" Celebrated for her unique designs for her own fashion house Sirivannavari, which has attracted considerable attention not just in Thailand but also internationally, the Princess was also named Silpathorn Artist in Fashion Design in 2018. In the sports arena, Princess Sirivannavari has also been known as a talented horse rider in dressage. To her, horse riding goes well with fashion in tastefulness and beauty. Having participated in various international horse gatherings and competitions across Europe, the Princess entered several competitions as a member of the Thai equestrian team. She has established the Princess's Cup Thailand with the main objective to promote awareness of equestrian sports among Thais and show the world Thailand's ability to host major events. She also initiated the ""Best Groom"" and ""Best Farrier"" contests in Thailand in 2016. ""I wish the government realised that artists are not just professionals. Rather, artists are those who can help boost the country's economy. We can promote the country's image and the export of craftsmanship. Thai artists are full of skills and lots of great ideas and creativity when they are at work. All this deserves to be fully promoted and to be turned into a reality."""
1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,Life,Wreaths for a good cause,"To prevent pollution caused by funeral bouquets, one company is adopting a new practice of sending recycled paper garlands and donating books Funeral wreaths are a common way to pay our final respect to the deceased. However, at the end of the funeral, wreaths turn into a large pile of garbage which is harmful to the environment as they are made up of foam and plastic. Each year, according to the Department of Environmental Quality Promotion (DEQP), more than 128,000 wreaths are left at 456 temples across Bangkok. The DEQP pointed out that trash piles from wreaths cause odour pollution and when burned cause air pollution. Therefore, the DEQP encourages people to offer other items such as trees, fans, blankets and kitchen utensils to the dead instead of flower wreaths. Three founders of a funeral wreath company, Pun Kan Di Book Wreath (Sharing Good Deeds) -- Kaimuk Pantaeng, Tachnondh Jarupatchanee and Chuenkamon Sreesompoch -- are aware of the environmental issues caused by flower wreaths. They started their company last year by launching ""book wreath"", which aims to reduce the environmental effects of wreaths by providing knowledge to people. Kaimuk revealed that the idea of book wreaths came while she was working with the Publishers and Booksellers Association of Thailand. At that time, she was working on a project called ""Nangsue Trongjai"", which helps readers get their hands on books they want. In this project, recipients can inform donators what type of books they want and the association will source them. At Pun Kan Di, customers can purchase two kinds of wreaths -- for 1,000 baht with one book donation or 2,000 baht with three book donations. After making the purchase, a recycled-paper wreath in the shape of a large beautiful book will be delivered to the funeral. People at the funeral will see the book wreath or a mock-up book with beautiful flower designs that will include the name of the purchaser(s) and the organisation to which Pun Kan Di will donate books. ""A wreath is a representation of the purchaser to pay respect to the deceased. However, books do not go with the deceased. We will collect money until we can purchase 100 books for an organisation such as a school, hospital, prison, temple or a community. After we deliver books to an organisation, we will send the purchasers a link about the donation details. We have already donated 100 books to the Foundation for Rural Youth and are now collecting money for the Education Centre for Sick Children at Phramongkutklao Hospital and the National Library for the Blind and Print Disabled. The representatives of these three organisations chose books from a list that we provided. They also can tell us what kind of books they want as well,"" explained Kaimuk. Tachnondh explained that they decide to purchase new books for each organisation because they learned that used book donations did not work. ""The Mirror Foundation has reported that 80% of the second-hand books can not be used. Most of them are too old or not up to date or not appropriate for young readers. After each donation, these used books become garbage and a burden,"" explained Tachnondh. ""We let people at an organisation choose the books because to promote reading, we must let people read what they want. This way, readers will enjoy reading and develop their habit further. If we force children to read textbooks instead of letting them read comics or children books, it may turn them against reading,"" added Chuenkamon. The trio -- Kaimuk, Tachnondh and Chuenkamon -- became friends and partners after they met at several volunteer activities. Pun Kan Di Book Wreath was established because they wanted to run a business with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). ""I was inspired by many successful companies with CSR initiatives in the US and the UK. For instance, a Los Angeles-based company, Toms Shoes has a signature charity programme titled 'One For One'. When a customer purchases a pair of shoes, one pair will be donated to an impoverished child. Their programme is successful in terms of sales and it has become a fashion trend. Hence, we wanted to launch a company with a CSR initiative that can survive in the business world,"" said Tachnondh. While Chuenkamon runs On-Art Book Publishing, Kaimuk is a public relations executive for many book fairs. Meanwhile. Tachnondh is better known as DJ Fiat at Green Wave 106.5. The trio became interested in book wreaths because they are avid readers and believe it can improve people's abilities. Chuenkamon commented that reading is a basic skill to enable learning which will lead to better writing and communion skills. ""When we listen to others, their messages include their interpretations. If we read, we will analyse content and come up with our own interpretations. Besides gaining knowledge, reading inspires our imagination. I like to read quotes and good quotes should be something that readers can relate to, understand and analyse,"" explained Tachnondh. ""We do not work on alternative wreaths because knowledge helps to develop people to become lifelong learners. Readers can develop their skills, pursue careers and eventually support themselves, said Kaimuk. To ensure that their book donations are useful, the trio carefully chooses the recipient organisations. They visit the organisations and examine their libraries before making decisions. ""We survey their bookshelves and libraries to see how each organisation manages its stock of books. Every organisation that we have worked with has so far made the most out of the books they have received. They do not leave books unused. In the future, we may have a volunteer librarian establish a library system, so people in an organisation can learn how to manage donated books,"" Kaimuk. Most books donated to their two selected organisations, Foundation for Rural Youth and Education Centre for Sick Children at Phramongkutklao Hospital, have been children books because the foundation and the centre aim to educate children. However, the National Library for the Blind and Print Disabled is a different matter. Tachnondh who usually reads books for the visually impaired said people send many dharma books to the library but they are not what the visually impaired want. ""They want professional development books such as social marketing. They also want poetry books, computer books, law books, English language books and children books,"" said Tachnondh. As a new business, the founders intend to continue to improve many aspects. They also hope many people will benefit from their products. ""We will make it as friendly an environment as possible. We are learning about soymilk ink and may use it in the future. We have also learned from customers' comments and gradually improved our product,"" said Chuenkamon. ""To protect the product from rain and damage during delivery, we cover the wreath with a reusable dialysis bag which is produced from a hospital in Yasothon province. In the future, we will find an inmate who is an artist to design our wreaths, so he/she will earn income from it. We saw the Art for Cancer project in which cancer patients created artworks. We will use the artworks of those cancer patients for our wreaths and share the income with them,"" said Kaimuk."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,Life,Point of no return,"Campaigners are hoping to raise public awareness about waste in a bid to avoid a looming climate catastrophe The world has about six years and 10 months left before its carbon budget -- the amount of carbon dioxide that can be released into the atmosphere at the current rate -- will be completely depleted. Unless human beings join hands to limit global warming under the 1.5C safe threshold, they will face worsening famines, disasters, and displacement. The climate clock by two artists, Gan Golan and Andrew Boyd, in Manhattan's Union Square, is a stark reminder of how destructive and fragile we are. While some deny the science of climate change, others are sounding a clarion call for action. In 2018, Greta Thunberg started protesting in front of the Swedish Parliament to keep up the pressure on her government to meet the target of carbon emissions. She skipped classes to strike every Friday and asked students around the world to join her, which had a ripple effect everywhere. Recently, the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement, an international accord to tackle global warming after US President Joe Biden signed an executive order last month and reversed Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the climate deal that came into force in 2016. The EU has set its sights on becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Thailand is also stepping up efforts to resolve the climate crisis. In a recent forum titled ""Invisible Waste: Lessons Learned To Combat Global Warming"", organised by the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), many campaigners pushed for a circular economy -- a model where resources are continually reused for the sustainable future of the planet -- to reduce garbage and greenhouse gas emissions. Preventing waste Chaiyod Bunyagidj, vice-president of the Thai Sustainable Consumption and Production Network, said if temperatures continue to rise by 2C, the situation will reach the point of no return. The question then is how prepared are we as all of us are contributing to climate change. ""The world's environmental sustainability is measured by its ecological footprint. It shows how much resources we use. Meanwhile, biocapacity can indicate how much resources our ecosystem can regenerate. It is like a piggy bank,"" he said. Chaiyod drew attention to data from 1961-2017 in the latest edition of the National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts 2021. It revealed that the world's ecological footprint was 2.8 but its biocapacity was 1.6, leading to a deficit of 1.2. When it comes to Thailand, its ecological footprint was 2.6 but its biocapacity 1.2, meaning there is a deficit of 1.4. ""Have our National Economic and Social Development Plans created balance? If so, why are we ending up in the red? If it is business as usual, we will have to find two and a half new planets by 2050 because we won't have enough resources,"" he said. In the current linear economy, goods are manufactured from raw materials, sold in large quantities, and thrown away. Overconsumption is fuelling the climate crisis due to greenhouse gas emissions from waste. Suthat Ronglong, the founder and chief executive officer of Do in Thai Co Ltd, an information technology company, said the research by Joseph Poore and Thomas Nemecek shows food production accounts for 26% of greenhouse gas emissions (an equivalent of 400,000 nuclear bombs). About 6% of these emissions come from food waste and loss. ""The third target under the SDG12 (responsible consumption and production) calls for halving per capita food waste and reducing food loss by 2030. We should know how much food waste we generate. For example, can we plan the amount of food ahead of a party? How many orders do we place? How much food do we consume? How much is it left? Is it disposed of in landfills? If so, it will produce methane, which is 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide [in terms of trapping heat],"" he said. Suthat stressed that source reduction is the most effective way of preventing waste. He is carrying out a food donation programme for those in need but the problem is that people are complacent about wasting food because they assume that leftovers will be given to the hungry. ""In light of this, we decided to track surplus food and informed people of what they discard. Instead of waiting for us, they should reduce food wastage from the start. Otherwise, we will become another trash can,"" he said. Suthat said rooftop farming developed on compost from food waste will be the way forward. As part of the circular economy model, people can walk to another rooftop and eat food that comes from the waste management system. ""It is the beauty of what we call compost,"" he added. Leftovers can be donated to feed hungry people or it can be diverted to feed animals and used for industrial or agricultural purposes. Landfill and incineration should be the last resort used. Redefining waste If human consumption inevitably generates waste, what else should we do? The statistics from the Thailand Environment Institute shows that the coronavirus outbreak increased the amount of plastic waste from 2.12 million tonnes in 2019 to 3.4 million tonnes in 2020, up by 62%. However, only 660,000 tonnes was recycled last year. Many businesses are now turning garbage into something else. Somsak Borrisuttanakul, the chief executive officer of TPBI, said his staff has launched the ""Won"" campaign to sort and recycle plastic packages. ""The company has collaborated with many agencies and set up 400 drop-off points. So far, we have collected over 100,000kg of plastic. It is recycled into reusable plastic bags and upcycled into other products. Plastic can be transformed into something of value,"" he said. The ""Care The Whale"" project can serve as another textbook example of waste management for the circular economy. Noppakao Sucharitakul, executive vice-president of SET, said the campaign seeks to make use of materials to the very end. ""How can we make trash disappear before it ends up in a whale's stomach? Previously, there have been reports about dead whales with rubbish inside. We joined hands with organisations on Ratchadaphisek Road and calculated the reduced carbon footprint. Last year, we reduced 4.27 million kilogrammes of carbon dioxide [equal to planting 474,277 mature trees],"" she said. Imagination can make a huge difference in tackling waste. Wishulada Panthanuvong, the social activist artist, is working with local people in Nonthaburi's Bang Yai district to create works of art from rubbish. One of them is a whale sculpture made of plastic waste and other leftovers in her studio. It can absorb over 1,000kg of carbon dioxide equivalents. ""It can show the magnitude of waste normally measured in numbers and raise public awareness,"" she said. Call for public cooperation Given the situation, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Varawut Silpa-archa said even if the whole country is turned into a forest, it can't offset its carbon emissions of around 350 million tonnes per year. In the 20-year national strategy (2017-37), the government plans to increase forest land from 31.6% to 40%, but that will only help absorb only 100 million tonnes. Varawut, however, affirmed Thailand's commitment to the Paris Agreement. It passed the first phase of reducing its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by 7-15% and is now entering the second phase of cutting NDCs by 20-25% in energy, logistics, and industry sectors. ""Prime Minister Prayut is pushing for the bio, circular and green (BCG) economy. In the past, it was just corporate social responsibility but now it is gaining traction from many private companies. However, some aren't falling in line. If we enforce this policy, it will speed up our transition to the BCG,"" he said. He said the implementation of environmental policies requires public cooperation. If people don't follow them, they will be only ""letters on paper"". Tackling environmental problems takes as much time as causing them."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,Life,A reflection of the fragility of life,"The greatness of nature and the fragility of life are reflected in a meaningful art piece called Gravity Of Thoughts at The Peninsula Bangkok, Charoen Nakhon Road, until March 31. This is a new fabric installation by Narissara Pianwimungsa, an artist-in-residence, who brings the art of embroidery to life through multiple touchpoints at the riverfront hotel. She took inspiration from her feelings about the power of nature along with her chaotic state of mind as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has brought with it an unprecedented effect on public health and the economy. Back then, Narissara was in pursuit of life-balance after the waves of fear and panic disappeared. Every time she got on a river-crossing ferry, she could feel the power of nature remain the same, despite the countless circumstances that life throws at humanity. Sometimes the stream appears gentle, while at other times it is harsh. She started to wonder about the balance of the stream and life and expressed her ideas through her fabric installation. It consists of a sculpture made of calicoes hanging from the ceiling, so the meticulous weight ensures its balance is precise. Its shape was inspired by ripples on the surface of water. Her three other embroidery works are displayed at the hotel's Lobby and Artist Studio. A graduate with a Master's of Fine Arts from Silpakorn University, Narissara has various and diverse approaches to her art from drawing, painting and embroidery to sculpture and site-specific work. She was awarded the 15th Silpa Bhirasri Creativity Grant by Silpakorn University in 2015."
28-ก.พ.-21,13:45,Life,Golden Globes to launch pandemic-era Hollywood awards season,"LOS ANGELES: Hollywood's award season kicks off Sunday at a very different Golden Globes, with a mainly virtual ceremony set to boost or dash the Oscars hopes of early frontrunners like ""Nomadland"" and ""The Trial of the Chicago 7."" Usually a star-packed, laid-back party that draws Tinseltown's biggest names to a Beverly Hills hotel ballroom, this pandemic edition will be broadcast from two scaled-down venues, with frontline and essential workers among the few in attendance. Deprived of its usual glamour, the Globes -- which also honor the best in television -- remain a coveted prize, and a high-profile source of momentum in the run-up to the season-crowning Oscars, which were pushed back this year to April. ""Nomadland,"" Chloe Zhao's paean to a marginalized, older generation of Americans roaming the West in rundown vans, has long been viewed as a frontrunner for the Globes' top prize. But it will face stiff competition from Aaron Sorkin's ""Chicago 7,"" a courtroom drama about the city's anti-war riots in 1968 with a mouth-watering ensemble cast including Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne and Sacha Baron Cohen. Both films are fueled by their timely themes of protest and joblessness. ""I think that it's likeliest between them,"" said The Hollywood Reporter's awards columnist Scott Feinberg. ""And then the spoiler, if something were to come out of left field, would probably be 'Promising Young Woman,' which is just unlike anything else in recent memory."" Its star Carey Mulligan -- playing a revenge-seeker who lurks at bars, feigning drunkenness to lure men into revealing their own misogyny -- is tipped by many to win best actress. She will have to fend off Frances McDormand's grounded and nuanced turn alongside a cast of non-actors in ""Nomadland,"" and Viola Davis' portrayal of a legendary 1920s crooner in ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom."" 'Hard to resist' The other films vying for best drama, the night's final and most prestigious prize, are ""Mank"" -- David Fincher's ode to ""Citizen Kane,"" which topped the overall nominations with six -- and ""The Father"" starring Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins, who has never won a competitive Globe despite seven previous nominations, has been showered with praise for his harrowing portrayal of the onset of dementia. But he is up against sentimental favorite Chadwick Boseman, the ""Black Panther"" star who died last August from cancer at age 43. Boseman is nominated for his kinetic performance as a tragic young trumpet player opposite Davis in ""Ma Rainey."" ""This is his best part, and the backstory is that he knew this might be his last performance -- so that's kind of hard to resist,"" said Variety awards editor Tim Gray. The race will be closely watched by groups including Time's Up, who this week slammed the Globes-awarding Hollywood Foreign Press Association for failing to admit a single Black member. ""I support and congratulate all the nominees, but the HFPA needs to change in meaningful ways,"" tweeted actress Olivia Wilde. ""Cosmetic fixes are not enough. #TimesUpGlobes."" The HFPA released a statement recognizing that ""we need to bring in Black members, as well as members from other underrepresented backgrounds."" 'Two white guys' The organization has voted for just one female as best director in 77 editions -- and only ever nominated five women in the category before this year -- but ""Nomadland"" director Zhao is tipped to buck that trend. The race to emulate Barbra Streisand's 1984 win for ""Yentl"" has two other contenders: Emerald Fennell (""Promising Young Woman"") and Regina King (""One Night in Miami""). ""This is a year when women have strong movies... that is good news, and deserving,"" said Deadline awards columnist Pete Hammond. ""But we'll see how it goes -- in the end, David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin, two white guys, may win."" Unlike the Oscars, the Globes split most movie categories into drama and ""musical or comedy,"" with Baron Cohen's ""Borat"" sequel and the Disney+ film of hit musical ""Hamilton"" leading the latter fields. Baron Cohen also has a best supporting actor nod for ""Chicago 7,"" while the Globes offer ""Hamilton"" its best shot at film honors after the Oscars declared the taping of Broadway shows ineligible. 'Notice to Oscar voters' The A-list audience and nominees are expected to largely remain at home, accepting awards via videolink -- similar to the format of September's widely praised Emmys. ""The Life Ahead"" director Edoardo Ponti told AFP he would be watching from his California home, while his mother and leading lady Sophia Loren remains in Switzerland. ""Of course you know it's going to be three o'clock in the morning when our category is up"" for Loren, said Ponti. ""As soon as I know something, whatever happens, I'll communicate the news to her."" Their movie competes for best foreign-language film, in a category featuring acclaimed Korean-American family drama ""Minari,"" which is viewed by some as an outside Oscar best picture candidate. Sunday's Globes ceremony is being held just five days before Oscars voting begins. ""Those wins will be fresh,"" said Gray. ""If you win a Golden Globe... it's a notice to Oscar voters -- you'd better see this film before you vote, because it's worth looking at."""
28-ก.พ.-21,8:45,Life,"Hollywood, history combine in Churchill art auction","RABAT: Hollywood's Angelina Jolie and Britain's iconic wartime prime minister Sir Winston Churchill, a keen artist who took inspiration from the Moroccan city of Marrakesh, are combining for a March 1 date at Christie's auction house in London. ""The Tower of the Koutoubia Mosque"", an oil painting Churchill produced during a World War II visit, is tipped to fetch between pound sterling1.5 million and pound sterling2.5 million ($2 million and $3.5 million), according to a Christie's estimate. Put up for auction by Angelina Jolie, it is vaunted in Christie's catalogue as ""Churchill's most important work. Aside from its distinguished provenance, it is the only landscape he made"" during the war. A career army officer before entering politics, Churchill started to paint relatively late, at the age of 40. His passion for the translucent light of Marrakesh, far from the political storms and drab skies of London, dates back to the 1930s when most of Morocco was a French protectorate, and he went on to make six visits to the North African country over the course of 23 years. ""Here in these spacious palm groves rising from the desert the traveller can be sure of perennial sunshine... and can contemplate with ceaseless satisfaction the stately and snow-clad panorama of the Atlas Mountains,"" he wrote in 1936 in Britain's Daily Mail newspaper. He would set up his easel on the balconies of the grandiose La Mamounia hotel or the city's Villa Taylor, beloved by the European jet set of the 1970s. It was from the villa, after a historic January 1943 conference in Casablanca with US president Franklin Roosevelt and France's Charles de Gaulle, that he painted what came to be regarded as his finest work, of the minaret behind the ramparts of the Old City, with mountains behind and tiny colourful figures in front. ""You cannot come all this way to North Africa without seeing Marrakesh,"" he is reputed to have told Roosevelt. ""I must be with you when you see the sun set on the Atlas Mountains."" A newspaper photograph taken at the time shows the two wartime Allied leaders admiring the sunset. 'Truly remarkable panorama' After the US delegation had left, Churchill stayed on an extra day and painted the view of the Koutoubia Mosque framed by the mountains. He sent it to Roosevelt for his birthday. ""This is Churchill's diplomacy at its most personal and intense,"" said Christie's head of modern British and Irish art, Nick Orchard. ""It is not an ordinary gift between leaders. This is soft power, and it is what the special relationship is all about."" Sold by the Roosevelt family in the 1950s, it changed hands several times before passing on to Hollywood dream couple Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in 2011, well before their high-profile separation. A second Churchill landscape, ""Scene in Marrakesh"", painted on his first visit to Morocco in 1935, is also going under the hammer at Christie's on Monday. That was painted while on a stay at Mamounia, where he marvelled at the ""truly remarkable panorama over the tops of orange trees and olives"", in a letter to his wife Clementine. The hotel today has a suite and a bar named after its illustrious guest."
28-ก.พ.-21,4:00,Life,"Aged abbot's lament, soldier blackmailer, twisted hubby","Ex-monk turns rotten An eldery abbot is in shock after a young man whom he nurtured through his early years at his Suphan Buri temple betrayed him by stealing more than one million baht. Phra Khru Wimonpariyatyaporn (Luang Phor Thong Sukinprasert), 89, abbot of Wat Uya is a member of the old school of monks who deposits temple donations in his own bank account. However, until recently he relied on the services of a former temple boy who was in 2011 ordained at Wat Uya, known as Thanakorn (no surname supplied), or Phra Jay as he was back then, to do the banking. Phra Jay was a diligent monk, ingratiating himself with elders, helping organise functions, doing the paperwork and taking the temple into the technology age. The temple, spread over a 38 rai site, is casting what will be the country's tallest bronze statue of Luang Phor Sothorn, a revered Buddha image. Phra Jay served in the monkood for five years, with the abbot helping pay his way through Pali language studies. He graduated in Phra Pariyatti Dhamma level three, enough to give him the title of ""maha"" before his name. However, the abbot said Jay met a woman about three years ago and decided to leave the monkhood. The couple married in November last year. Shortly after he left, Jay, who was still helping with the temple's banking, took the abbot to Krungthai Bank. While there, reports say he asked for the abbot's ID card and quietly set up a banking app on his phone which linked his own account to the abbot's. Luang Phor Suk, the abbot, deposited his monthly wages of 3,100 baht while he was there. Later the same day, Jay secretly transferred the money to his own account via the app. Reports say he made his next withdrawal in November last year, taking 37,205 baht. In the same month, he married his bride. The transfers carried on until he had cleaned out the account both of the abbot's wages, paid in over three years, and 890,000 baht in temple donations, the total reaching 1,001,600 baht. Luang Phor Suk discovered the funds were missing when temple assistants took him to the bank on Feb 17 so he could withdraw money to pay the temple's labourers. The temple spends most of its annual donations on the statue project, which Luang Phor Suk hopes to finish before he dies. Today after a 10-year effort all that remains is the lower part of the base, but that will require a big chunk of money for materials and wages. When standing the statue will be 24m tall, its lap 18m wide. Bank staff told him they couldn't withdraw the money as the account was empty but for 33 baht. Staff asked him what app he used, but Luang Phor Suk said he didn't have one, as he doesn't know how to use a smartphone. The bank's inquiries led back to Jay, who admitted taking the money via the bank app, spending it on his marriage dowry, a deposit on a new home, and a car. News reports, which dug up FB posts of Jay and his new wife celebrating their nuptials, said the pair were enjoying the good life while the temple, which had helped give Jay his start in life, was left to beg for money to pay its bills. Phra Mahakamol Kodpunyo, assistant to the abbot, said he called Jay about the theft. He offered to pay it back at the rate of 10,000 baht a month. While the abbot was happy not to pursue the matter of his own stolen wages, he felt obliged to go to police over the missing donations, as that was public money. ""Phra Jay was clever, helped the temple develop, connected CCTV cameras to the premises, and drew close to the abbot. Locals paid him respect and admired his talent,"" he said, recalling Jay's contribution. ""The abbot was saddened and disappointed to hear Jay was behind it, as he supported him and trusted him. ""All I can do is give the abbot strength and look after his bruised feelings. He was close to the young man and he turned and did this to him,"" he said. Luang Phor Suk said he feels stressed about the theft but has to try to come to terms with the loss so he can be happy. He is also worried people will not want to make merit at the temple any more. The temple, which says it has been unable to reach Jay since, wants him to contact elders to reach a settlement. It is unclear whether the temple has gone to police. Amarin TV's Tub Tho Kaow news show, which covered the saga, asked if Jay was watching and warned him about the potential jail time for theft. He is said to be working at a factory in Pathum Thani. Private stains military record A secondary student blackmailed by a soldier into sending him money in return for keeping her naked images under wraps has forgiven him. A teacher at the girl's school in Satuek district, Buri Ram, contacted police last week to say a soldier had been blackmailing her student, Kung. She was sending the money secretly from her father's bank account and was so depressed about her stealing that she contemplated suicide. Kung and the soldier had grown close on the internet and exchanged images of themselves naked. The soldier, Pvt Watcharapol Kaewudom, 22, from the 4th Infantry Battalion's 23rd regiment, had told her that if she didn't send money he would release the images on the internet. He asked for an initial 300-500 baht, but when that eventually grew to demands for 2,000 baht, Kung, who knew the password to her father's bank account, did not know where to turn. Her teacher noticed the girl looking depressed and asked her what was wrong. After she disclosed details of the saga, the teacher took her to seek help from the police. Police contacted Pvt Watcharapol, who admitted blackmailing the girl. They had met on the internet about six months ago, he said. Kung's father, 60 said he knew nothing about the saga and had not noticed the money going missing. By way of apology, the army has repaid the money and is also helping Kung with her education. Gen Adul Boonthamcharoen, commander of the 6th Infantry Battalion and head of the Suranaree Command, ordered the soldier's superior to take Pvt Watcharapol to Kung's parents and ask their forgiveness. News images showed him prostrating himself before her mother. Kung's parents and teacher said they forgave the young man, and offered him strength as he undergoes the likely jail time which awaits. After accepting his apology both sides hugged each other. Kung's mother said the young man's own parents are ailing. ""I hope he can emerge from this ordeal a better person so he can take care of them when he gets out,"" she said. She admitted her daughter was in a bad way mentally during the ordeal. Out with the old... Udon Thani police say they want to hear from a man who threw his wife out of their marital home, claiming she was unfaithful, only to start seeing a lover of his own. ""A"", 43, from Nong Han district, said her husband of 24 years, ""B"", had driven her out of their home after assaulting her. He claimed she had been unfaithful, which was not true. However, she discovered later that he himself had been seeing someone else, and suspects he ejected her to try to transfer blame. A, a beautician, has two children by B, a factory worker aged 45. She said the couple had worked hard and saved to buy their own home in the district. She claims they were happy, though B's behaviour started to change at New Year when he started getting jealous and forbade her from talking to other men. Last month, claiming she had been seeing someone else, he hit her with a piece of plywood. A said she packed her bags and asked her son to take her to a friend's place for shelter. On Valentine's Day, hoping her husband had calmed down and they could make a new start, she took B some roses to appease him. Her husband, however, slapped her face and told her to leave. She went to stay at her father's home amid claims, spread by B among family and friends, that she had left him. A said a sympathiser later sent her images of her husband with another woman, sharing a meal, hugging and at a hotel. When she confronted him with the images, he admitted seeing her. However, he refused to divorce A and said he would rather kill his wife than let her go. A said she had also spoken to the new woman in B's life, who mocked her because her husband had chosen her instead. The beautician said when she took her children to see B's parents, she was shocked to learn B had taken the woman there for introductions. He told them A had left him. A, who took along her marriage certificate to show police, warned women to make sure they register their marriages, as they do not know what lies ahead. She said she would file for a divorce to ensure B splits up their marital assets so she has something to leave their children, aged 21 and 17. She will also pursue charges of threatening to kill against her husband. Pol Maj Plewthong Sareenan, an inspector at Nong Han station, said police would call in B to explain the threats against his wife."
1-มี.ค.-21,14:45,Sports,Chinese media urge football rethink after champions' financial collapse,"SHANGHAI - The ""shocking"" collapse of champions Jiangsu FC is a watershed for Chinese football that should prompt a rethink from top to bottom, state media said. Jiangsu, who are owned by the conglomerate Suning -- which also owns Italy's Inter Milan -- said Sunday they will ""cease operations"", just over three months after winning the Chinese Super League. The announcement underlines the financial problems coursing through the league that could also see rival side Tianjin Tigers fold this week. It also highlights the declining fortunes of a league that repeatedly smashed the Asian transfer record just a few years ago, attracting a number of foreign stars. ""It seems incredible and shocking, but it feels like the dust has now settled,"" state-run Xinhua news agency said following the announcement by Jiangsu, who have not yet dissolved and are seeking a financial lifeline. Xinhua said that 16 teams across three tiers of Chinese football folded in 2020. The Super League gained a reputation for luring star players with hefty wages and exorbitant transfer fees -- Shanghai SIPG signed Oscar from Chelsea in 2017 for an Asian-record 60 million euros. But the Chinese Football Association has since brought in a raft of measures to cool spending, including a 100 percent transfer tax and salary caps. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, money began to dry up in Chinese football. ""The most important thing at the moment is to... reload and start again, rather than being lost in confusion or remorse,"" said Xinhua. ""To some extent it is a good thing that the bubble has burst earlier (than expected),"" it added. ""Chinese professional football has ushered in its first 'watershed' after its high-speed, wild growth. ""Respect the laws of football, respect the laws of the market, adhere to youth training and work for the long term."" Beijing Youth Daily said the implosion of Jiangsu was an opportunity for renewal. ""Where does Chinese football go from here?"" it asked. ""Experts say that to solve the predicament of Chinese football it must be overthrown and reconstructed. ""Chinese football, the promotion of it and youth training all need to be reassessed."" The new season, which will almost certainly be shorn of Jiangsu and Tianjin, is expected to start in April but there is no definite date because of uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus."

World number one Ashleigh Barty, reigning Wimbledon champion Simona Halep and former Australian Open winner Sofia Kenin have all withdrawn, thinning an already diminished field. The tournament took a further hit Saturday when French Open champion Iga Swiatek also withdrew moments after winning the Adelaide WTA title. The absences leave fifth-ranked Svitolina and Karolina Pliskova, the world number six, the headline acts with the highest-ranked Arab player in WTA history Ons Jabeur as well as Egypt's Mayar Sherif also taking to the hard courts in Doha. This month's delayed Australian Open was characterised by a hard lockdown which saw players confined to their quarantine hotels, highlighting the challenges of staging sporting events in the age of Covid-19. Qatar has pressed ahead with events despite seeing an uptick in virus cases, staging the FIFA Club World Cup earlier this month with stadiums at 30 percent capacity. America's Denis Kudla was told he had tested positive for the coronavirus mid-match at the Australian Open qualifying tournament in Doha last month. He then sealed victory before going into quarantine. Qatar recorded 118 new cases per 100,000 people in the past seven days, up two percent from the week before. Spectators will be required to present a contact tracing app, undergo temperature checks and wear masks at all times. Attendance will be limited by law to 20 percent of capacity. Jabeur meanwhile said she ""had a little bit of time to practice following Melbourne... a small pre-season to kind of get back on the court"". She and around 70 others were forced to isolate ahead of the first Grand Slam of 2021 after virus cases were detected in other passengers on their charter flight. ""I feel great back here in Doha, one of my favourite places -- it's an extra motivation to work even harder,"" she said ahead of the tournament at the Khalifa International Tennis Complex. ""I've never won here before but it's a big deal for an Arab man or woman to win such a tournament, honestly it's one of my goals."" Earlier this month, Sherif became the first Egyptian woman to win a main draw Grand Slam match at the Australian Open, defeating fellow qualifier Chloe Paquet in straight sets. World number 11 Kiki Bertens will return to the WTA Tour for the first time since 2020 Roland Garros after undergoing achilles surgery in October. ""I'm feeling good. It's been a while of course... I've had lots of rehab and recovery -- ready and hungry to play,"" she said. Bertens said that preparing for the tournament amid the pandemic ""was tough"". ""Lots of things were closed... I had some exceptions so I could at least practice. Of course everything for me was indoors because it was winter in the Netherlands. For me to play outdoors again it's a big difference."" Maximum temperatures in the coming week will hover between 25 and 27 degrees Celsius."
1-มี.ค.-21,4:30,Sports,Diogo fires 3 to put Rabbits within one win of T1 glory,"BG Pathum United moved to with one win of claiming their first ever Thai League 1 title when they hammered Samut Prakan City 6-0 on Sunday night. The Rabbits showed hosts Samut Prakan City no mercy as they maintained their 19-point lead at the top of the table. With only seven matches remaining this season, Pathum could wrap up the title at their home ground on Thursday when they host Sukhothai. Diogo Luis Santo had a hat-trick, Victor Cardozo struck twice and Santiparb Channgom scored one goal for the Rabbits. Meanwhile, Port ended their five-game winless run in the league, which included four losses, with a 3-1 home victory over bottom-placed Rayong that helped them reclaim a share of second spot last night. Former champions Buriram United, who defeated Nakhon Ratchasima 3-0 in a northeastern derby on Saturday night, had taken sole possession of second spot, but Port's victory last night helped them tie the Thunder Castle on 44 points. Port went on the front foot from the word go and found themselves leading the visitors 1-0 in the sixth minute when Nelson Bonilla set up Siwakorn Jakkuprasart to score from close range. Khlong Toey-based Port got their second in the 38th minute when Pakorn Prempak crossed the ball to Sergio Suarez to score with a header. Rayong were able to reduce deficit by one early in the second half but Metee Sarakum's strike was followed by a penalty for Port which was converted by Suarez to seal the fate of the match in the 83rd minute. Struggling Chonburi also found their scoring boots again at their home ground and handed Suphanburi a 4-1 defeat. Suphanburi had a quick goal through Rithiporn Warnchuen, but Chonburi then hit the target four times as Renato Kelic (10th minute), Kritsada Kaman (22nd), Panupong Polsa (47th) and Eliandro (80th) scored for the Sharks. Also last night, fifth-placed True Bangkok United were 1-0 winners at Sukhothai thanks to an 18th-minute strike from Vander Luis."
1-มี.ค.-21,1:45,Sports,"Man Utd frustrated by penalty row in Chelsea stalemate, Bale stars for Spurs","LONDON: Manchester United were left frustrated by a VAR penalty controversy in their 0-0 draw at Chelsea, while the revitalised Gareth Bale struck twice in Tottenham's 4-0 rout of Burnley on Sunday. Second-placed United had hoped to close the gap on Manchester City with a victory at Stamford Bridge. But instead they now sit 12 points behind the Premier League leaders as their title hopes fade following a run of one win from four games. Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel is unbeaten in nine matches in all competitions since replacing the sacked Frank Lampard, but the stalemate was a blow to his team's top-four challenge. The fifth-placed Blues are one point behind fourth-placed West Ham and four ahead of sixth-placed Liverpool, who visit Sheffield United in Sunday's late game. Neither side could claim they deserved to win in a game of few clear-cut chances. The biggest talking point came in the first half when United's appeal for a penalty was rejected by referee Stuart Attwell after he consulted the pitchside monitor when Callum Hudson-Odoi appeared to handle in a challenge with Mason Greenwood. After five defeats in their previous six league games, Tottenham eased the pressure on Jose Mourinho with a significant contribution from Bale, who made just his third league start of the season. The Wales forward's most impressive display since his season-long loan move from Real Madrid gave him four goals in his last four appearances. Bale, who had clashed with Tottenham boss Mourinho over his fitness earlier in February, took just 68 seconds to score with a clinical close-range finish from Son Heung-min's cross. In the 15th minute, Bale's superb long pass picked out Harry Kane's run and the England captain's shot deflected off James Tarkowski for his 22nd goal of the season. Lucas Moura netted with a predatory finish after Sergio Reguilon's cross was deflected into the Brazilian's path by Tarkowski in the 31st minute. Bale, in his second spell with Tottenham after leaving for Madrid in 2013, scored again with a cool strike from Son's 55th-minute pass. Tottenham are up to eighth, six points behind the top four with a game in hand. ""Sometimes you (the media) like to say things that are not really true but there is not one single manager in the world that doesn't play Gareth Bale if Gareth Bale is in very good condition,"" Mourinho said. ""There is not one, but now he is better than ever. It's not just about the two goals he scored, it's fundamentally about his physical performance."" Arsenal down Leicester Arsenal delivered a hammer blow to Leicester's faint hopes of winning the title with an impressive 3-1 win. Mikel Arteta's side fell behind to Youri Tielemans' early goal at the King Power Stadium, but David Luiz equalised and Alexandre Lacazette's penalty gave Arsenal the lead. Nicolas Pepe's second-half goal sealed the Gunners' second win in their last six league games and their first success at a team in the Premier League's top three since 2015. Leicester remain in third place and trail City by 13 points with 12 games remaining. After Thursday's shock Europa League exit against Slavia Prague, it was a week to forget for Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers. With Arsenal stuck in mid-table, Arteta has prioritised winning the Europa League as his side's only hope of qualifying for next season's Champions League. Having picked his best team for the come-from-behind win against Benfica in the last 32 second leg on Thursday, Arteta left Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bukayo Saka on the bench after the long trip back from the neutral venue in Greece. After the gamble paid off, Arteta said: ""Coming into this game I was concerned. They're one of the most dangerous teams in the league to play once you go behind against them. ""The reaction was terrific, the team looked really mature."" Third-bottom Fulham are three points from safety after a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace."
28-ก.พ.-21,14:45,Sports,Alvarez crushes Yildirim to retain super middleweight crown,"MIAMI - Saul ""Canelo"" Alvarez demolished Turkey's Avni Yildirim in three rounds to retain his WBC and WBA super middleweight titles by knockout on Saturday. Mexico's Alvarez dominated underdog Yildirim from the opening bell and sent the Turk crashing to the canvas with a crisp left-right combination in the third round at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium. The outclassed Yildirim then failed to emerge from his corner for the fourth round as Alvarez once again demonstrated why he is regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighter in boxing. ""I wanted to have a great fight here and I did what I had to do,"" Alvarez said. ""I needed a knockout and that's what I did. It doesn't matter if they're taller, if they've got more reach, or they've got a good trainer. I came to do my job, I came here to win."" Alvarez, who improved to 55-1-2 with 37 knockouts, had got back into the ring on Saturday a little over two months after beating Britain's Callum Smith in December. After the fight, promoter Eddie Hearn said the 30-year-old Mexican star will next seek to add the World Boxing Organisation belt to his collection with a May 8 fight against Britain's Billy Joe Saunders. The Saunders fight will be the next step in Alvarez's quest to become the first undisputed super middleweight champion in boxing history. ""No one has done it,"" Alvarez said. ""I want to make history. No-one has done it at 168."" Alvarez meanwhile brushed off suggestions that he wants to be remembered as the greatest boxer Mexico has ever produced. ""I respect everyone but I want to make my own history,"" Alvarez said. Saturday's bout will give Saunders plenty of food for thought after Alvarez produced his trademark blend of technical skill and punching power to overwhelm mandatory challenger Yildirim. The 29-year-old Turk, fighting for the first time in two years, looked hesitant from the outset as Alvarez landed an array of hooks to the body and uppercuts to easily win the first round. The second round followed an identical pattern, with Yildirim barely offering any kind of resistance as Alvarez worked his opponent's ribcage mercilessly. The end came after a third round where Alvarez once again went on the attack against a passive Yildirim. A straight left from Alvarez smashed through Yildirim's guard and landed on his chin and the following right sent the Turk rocking backward to the canvas. Although Yildirim hung on for the remainder of the round, the end was nigh. As Yildirim slumped on his stool, trainer Joel Diaz could be heard telling his fighter he would give him only one more round before throwing in the towel. In the event, it never got that far as Yildirim failed to come out for the fourth to hand Alvarez victory by technical knockout."
28-ก.พ.-21,10:45,Sports,America's Cup on hold amid New Zealand's Covid lockdown,"WELLINGTON - The America's Cup final between Team New Zealand and Italy's Luna Rossa on Auckland's Waitemata Harbour was pushed back on Sunday as a coronavirus outbreak plunged the city back into lockdown. The first four races in the best-of-13 showdown were scheduled for next weekend but ""will not occur before at least Wednesday, March 10,"" America's Cup Events chair Tina Symmans said. ""We need to understand all likely scenarios so that an updated racing schedule can be put in place whilst also ensuring the regulatory requirements are met."" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern ordered a seven-day, level-three, lockdown in Auckland from 6am Sunday (1700 GMT Saturday) after a 21-year-old man visited a gym and other public areas after testing positive for the UK strain of the virus. It is the 13th case of Covid-19 in the community since the latest cluster emerged two weeks ago putting Auckland, New Zealand's largest city with a population of 1.7 million, into a three-day lockdown. Under level three, residents must stay at home except for essential shopping and work, while sport is banned. However, Symmans said America's Cup organisers would apply for an exemption to start racing if the lockdown continued longer than expected. Outside Auckland, the rest of New Zealand has been placed on level two, which restricts crowd numbers and rules out spectators -- forcing some sports to rearrange their schedules. The Twenty20 cricket match between New Zealand and Australia next Friday has been moved from Auckland to Wellington where it will be played in an empty stadium. In rugby, the Auckland Blues decided not to return home after their 31-16 Super Rugby Aotearoa win over the Hurricanes in Wellington on Saturday. Although they have a bye next week, coach Leon MacDonald said if they returned to Auckland they would not be allowed to train under the stringent level-three rules. Next weekend's Super Rugby matches between the Waikato Chiefs and Otago Highlanders and Canterbury Crusaders and Hurricanes will likely be played behind closed doors."
28-ก.พ.-21,8:45,Sports,Pivac sets Wales sights on bigger prize after Triple Crown triumph,"CARDIFF: Wales coach Wayne Pivac promised no let-up from his side after a decisive 40-24 win over England in Cardiff on Saturday secured the Triple Crown. Victory in a behind closed doors match at the Principality Stadium saw Wales compile their highest score against arch-rivals England. It also kept them on course for the Grand Slam ahead of matches away to Italy and France, with the defeat of reigning Six Nations champions England following Wales' wins over Ireland and Scotland. Wales scored four tries though Josh Adams, Liam Williams, Kieran Hardy and Cory Hill in a bonus-point win. England may have had reason to feel aggrieved with referee Pascal Gauzere for awarding the opening two tries. But any complaints England might have had about the officiating were tempered by the knowledge that even though they conceded 14 penalties, Gauzere did not sin-bin any of their players including repeat offender Maro Itoje. And having drawn level at 24-24 heading into the final quarter, it was England's indiscipline that allowed Wales replacement fly-half Callum Sheedy to kick three decisive penalties late on. ""We talked about it being a special day for a lot of reasons -- George North's 100th Test match (for Wales), some silverware on the line and the opportunity to go deeper into the competition and push on,"" said Pivac. Wales will be huge favourites to beat Italy, thrashed 48-10 by Ireland earlier on Saturday in a 30th consecutive Six Nations defeat -- when they face the Azzurri in Rome on March 13. ""We have already spoken briefly about the importance of the next game,"" said Pivac. ""It would undo a lot of very good work if we didn't focus on that game and that game alone. ""Because we haven't really played the house down yet, we have well and truly got our feet on the ground,"" the New Zealander added. Meanwhile, Pivac praised Bristol stand-off Sheedy, who had been off-target in Wales' nailbiting 25-24 win away to Scotland last time out. ""After missing a couple of kicks up in Edinburgh, to come on in that situation, a very tight game, he had three difficult kicks and hit all three of them well."" Pivac's position was being called into question after he oversaw just three Wales wins from 10 Tests in 2020, with two victories over Italy and one against second-tier Georgia not much consolation when his side suffered six successive defeats. But the experienced Pivac weathered the storm. ""A lot of people may have thought that, at 24-24, England were coming pretty strong at us. But our guys found another gear again and we are very pleased with that,"" he said. ""For me personally it's about the players and providing them with an environment where they can come in and get the job done, keep improving. ""Hopefully, we are doing that and people are seeing that the hard work is starting to pay off. But there are still two big games to go."""

The 27-year-old from North Carolina bounced back from a bogey on the 17th to finish with a birdie on the last to join local hope Rafael Campos at the top of the leaderboard on 14 under heading into Sunday's final round. Murray's closing birdie capped a sparkling round which erupted early on with four birdies and three pars in his first seven holes at the Grand Reserve Golf Club in Rio Grande. A 10-foot birdie put on the ninth took him to five under for the round before two more birdies on the 12th and 14th pushed him into the lead. A bogey on the 17th threatened to sour his round, but Murray recovered to birdie the par-five 18th to ensure a share of the lead alongside Campos. Campos meanwhile -- ranked 666th in the world -- put himself in the frame for a fairytale first tour victory with a five-under-par 67. The 32-year-old made his PGA Tour debut at the Puerto Rico Open as an amateur in 2008 and has posted two top-10 finishes at the event in the years since. He looked set for a bogey-free round on Saturday after reeling off six birdies and 11 pars, before a bogey on the last dropped him back to five under for the day, 14 under overall. Campos and Murray lead by one shot from Australia's Cameron Percy and South African Branden Grace, who are at 13 under. Percy moved up the leaderboard with a five-under-par 67 while Grace carded a 68 for a second straight day. Overnight leader Brandon Wu meanwhile fell away with a one-under-par 71. Wu is two of the lead on 12 under alongside Argentina's Nelson Ledesma and Andrew Putnam."

The victory gave Buriram sole possession of second spot at least for a day with 44 points, 16 behind unbeaten leaders BG Pathum United. Port are heavy favourites to end their five-match winless run in the league and rejoin the Thunder Castle at No.2 when they host bottom-placed Rayong this evening. Arch-rivals SCG Muang Thong United also stayed in contention for a top-three finish with an injury-time Willian Popp goal taking them to 40 points following a 3-2 victory at relegation-threatened Trat. Nakhon Ratchasima had a brisk start with Gidi Kanuk sending a shot over the bar and Amadou Ouattara being denied by Buriram goalkeeper Siwarak Tedsungnoen. Buriram slowly wrested the control from the Swat Cats but they really got going after the break when Pansa Hemviboon put them on course to the victory in the 50th minute. Chalermpong Kerdkaew fouled Buriram's Samuel Rosa inside the box and the Brazilian converted the 70th-minute penalty to make it 2-0 before Maicon Marques added the third six minutes later. Muang Thong squandered a two-goal upper hand given to them by Suporn Pinakatapho (23rd minute) and Willian (56th). Ricardo Santos scored two for Trat, the second one coming off a penalty, to set up the stage for Willian's injury-time heroic act. Hosts Ratchaburi picked up a point following a 1-1 draw with Chiang Rai United and PT Prachuap failed to move away from the three-team relegation zone after a 1-1 away draw at Police Tero."

I loved watching Newton play as he was quick and bloody good. He was one of Australia's most successful golfers in the 1970s and early 1980s. He turned professional in 1971 and won his first professional tournament, the Dutch Open, in 1972. Newton notched up several victories over the next decade as he won titles such as the British Matchplay in 1974, the Buick-Goodwrench  In the 1975 British Open Championship at Carnoustie in Scotland, Newton lost in a play-off to Tom Watson. In the third round, Newton set a course record of 65, despite having injured an ankle so severely on the practice tee prior to the start of the championship that he had it professionally wrapped each day. In the 1983 incident, he lost his right arm and eye and sustained severe abdominal injuries. A severe rainstorm was in progress at the time, and in addition, safety aspects near the plane were deficient. Doctors gave this gifted Aussie player a 50-50 chance of surviving and after several days in a coma and eight weeks in intensive care he pulled through. Out of Bounds: Overheard at the 19th: ""On the 12th, I had four putts, however, I can honestly say that it wasn't my fault as the connection between my brain, hands and putter was temporally disrupted due to being six down at the time."""

He and his wife Janejira learned to make chocolate some years ago before they decided to open Rose Cocoa Garden. They once produced chocolate strictly for leisure. But today the family offers lots of choices of chocolate products. They also have opened their home for tourists to learn the process of making creamy chocolate. ""From bean-to-bar"" is the concept of their service. Visitors will have a chance to visit a cacao plantation that supplies fresh cacao fruits to Preecha. They will then have a chance to test the fresh white pulp of the fruit and learn how to make cocoa solids or chocolate liquor. The process of making cocoa liquor takes about 20 days, starting from fermenting ripe cacao beans for a week, then sun-drying them for another week. The beans are then roasted. Hulls must be peeled off and the roasted bean will be processed in a machine until it becomes a creamy and smooth liquid, which normally takes about four days. The taste of cocoa mass is not yet sweet but nutty, bitter and a little sour. Milk and sugar is added later to make chocolate.

""Want to know why it got such a name?"" Without waiting for my reply, Wissarut, a research experimental assistant at the facility, carefully brought the mantis out of the container and placed it in his palm. The predatory insect stood upright raising its large, sharp-spiked forelegs and fanning out its four wings, revealing the eyespots like those on a peacock's tail. The mantis itself explained to me in the most explicit way. Wissarut was guiding me through the insect sanctuary, a part of Lamtakhong Research Station, which is under the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation's Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research (TISTR). He noted that other than the peacock mantis, at this time of year visitors also can see flower mantises, including the pinkish orchid mantis. ""In March, the luna moth and Malayan moon moth will emerge from their cocoons. Meanwhile, the beautiful mantises will still be around until April,"" he said, adding that other kinds of creatures such as leaf and stick insects can be seen all year round. ""But please note that this is not a zoo,"" Wissarut pointed out, adding that he hoped visitors to the sanctuary learn a few things about insects and their diversity, as well as how we humans can co-exist with them. The major purpose of the facility, he elaborated, is for research. Wissarut and his colleagues at TISTR have been working on several projects that aim to seek eco-friendly solutions for farmers. Among them are studies on biopesticides, plants' chemical self-defense, organic cricket farming and yields and quality improvement of arabica coffee cherries with the help of stingless bees. There was so much to learn at the Tropical Insect Sanctuary and the Lamtakhong Research Station as a whole, the recent trip to Pak Chong was an eye-opening one for me. The Tropical Insect Sanctuary is part of Lamtakhong Research Station which is situated on Highway 2 near its well-known namesake reservoir, about 18km from Nakhon Ratchasima's Pak Chong railway station. Its neighbour on the opposite side of the road is the Military Dog Battalion which is easier to notice. The Tropical Insect Sanctuary is open daily, except for Mondays and Fridays.

The temple is located on Saran Rom Road. It was built by King Rama IV in 1864 and the wooden windows and doors of its Viharn Luang or the main prayer hall were created in 1865 in Japan. The abbot asked the FAD to help with the restoration process and the agency sent a sample of the items to the Tokyo National Research Institute for Cultural Properties to find what materials should be used for repairs as well as train some of its officers for the job. The Japanese research team will travel to Thailand to work with the FAD for the task. In total, the team will fix 94 wooden pieces. The work is expected to finish in the next four years. Tourists eye responsible post-Covid travel People are more mindful than ever about travelling due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a survey by IHG Hotels & Resorts. The research was commissioned as part of IHG's launch of ""Journey To Tomorrow"", a 10-year action plan to make a positive difference and help shape the future of responsible travel. About 60% of the 9,000 adults surveyed across the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, China, the United Arab Emirates and Australia agree that they want to be more environmentally and socially conscious about their travels. This change in attitude is led by younger travellers (69%) aged 18 to 24 compared to 55s and over (48%). Consumers are also willing to spend an average 31% more on accommodation if they know it is run responsibly -- with 51% happy to fork out more than 20% extra a night. The pandemic has made travellers more mindful about preserving and connecting with communities around them as 57% of participants said they care more about doing their bit for local communities and the planet while travelling now than they did 10 years ago. About 46% are more likely to be mindful about avoiding tourist activities that have a negative impact on the local environment and communities. Meanwhile, almost 86% agreed that it is important to know the local community when visiting somewhere new. To show support, visitors are ready to eat local food (67%), shop locally (64%), speak with the locals (61%), and get involved with local tours (48%).

25-ก.พ.-21,19:57,Travel,Thailand mulls waiving quarantine for vaccinated tourists,"Thailand may scrap its two-week mandatory quarantine for foreign visitors with proof of Covid-19 vaccination as the Southeast Asian nation seeks to revive its pandemic-hit tourism industry. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said on Tuesday his government will consider allowing visitors who can produce a vaccination certificate to skip the quarantine and authorities will come up with a plan to track them during their stay in the country. The plan to ease rules for tourists signal a shift in Thailand’s stance after months of insisting all visitors must stay in quarantine in the absence of enough evidence that inoculations can prevent virus transmission. If implemented, the move could bolster Thailand’s tourism sector that contributed about one-fifth to the nation’s pre-pandemic economy. ""If this goes ahead as planned, it will be a big boost to tourism and economy,"" Nattaporn Triratanasirikul, an economist at Kasikorn Research Center in Bangkok, said adding the government may need to weigh health concerns too. ""There is still a very high uncertainty on the economic outlook this year, pending all the issues related to the outbreak from local infections, vaccine rollouts and border reopening plan."" The central bank has singled out an uncertain recovery in tourist arrivals as ""a major risk"" to the medium-term growth outlook, with governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput saying it would be very difficult for the economy to return to pre-pandemic levels without tourism. The economy, which shrank the most since 1998 last year, will expand this year ""at somewhat a lower rate"" than the central bank’s December projection of 3.2%, it said this month. While Thailand has reopened its borders to most foreign visitors since October, strict quarantine rules have kept most tourists away. The local industry has been calling for relaxed quarantine rules to attract tourists from countries that have started vaccine rollouts, such as China, Singapore and the UK. Shares of Thai hotel and restaurant operators and Airports of Thailand Pcl gained on Tuesday as investors cheered the relaxation of restrictions that were put in place to curb a flare-up in new infections and the approval for vaccine made by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Thailand is set to receive its first doses of vaccines on Wednesday that will allow it start a national inoculation programme within a week. Thailand, which aims to inoculate 50% of its population by the end of this year, has also approved AstraZeneca’s vaccine for emergency use. The nation has ordered 61 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, to be locally produced by Siam Bioscience through technology transfer. The country will eventually allow registration and imports of several brands of Covid-19 vaccines as long as they meet local rules, and private hospitals will be permitted to administer the shots, Gen Prayut said. The government will control the distribution of vaccines only in the early stages, he said. ""Many companies have shown interest to register but their documents are not completed yet,"" Gen Prayut said. ""It is good that we will have more vaccines than the 65 million doses planned by the government now."""

18-ก.พ.-21,4:00,Travel,Finding peace in northern Thailand,"Lampang's ancient temples are a good place for Buddhists to make merit Next Friday will mark the Makha Bucha, also known as Magha Puja Day, another important day for Buddhists. It falls on the Full Moon day of the third lunar month in which 1,250 enlightened monks (or arahant) gathered to listen to Buddha teach his principles known as Ovadha Patimokha more than 2,500 years ago. The teaching roughly consists of three major concepts: do good, abstain from bad action and purify the mind. To observe the day, Buddhists normally go to a temple to make merit. One of my favourite places is Wat Phrathat Lampang Luang in Lampang province, about 600km north of Bangkok. The old temple is known as one of the most beautiful temples in the North. Locals believe that the temple is designated for people who were born in the astrological Year of the Ox -- which is this year -- because the temple was built and completed in the Year of the Ox. Some compare the temple to a well-preserved art gallery, with its old Lanna architecture and designs. (Lampang was part of Lanna Kingdom, one of the ancient Siamese kingdoms, founded by King Mangrai in the 13th century.) The Viharn Luang or main hall is unique. The wooden structure was built in 1476 without walls and has dozens of large wooden pillars fully covered with shining gold lacquer patterns. The pavilion houses a seated principal Buddha sculpture called Phra Chao Lan Thong as well as 500-year-old murals painted in Lanna style. The art depicts the story about the last 10 lives of Buddha. Another highlight is the old Lanka-style bell stupa or chedi, which contains Buddha's relics, or phrathat, in the Thai language. According to folklore, Buddha once visited the site and donated his hair, which has been kept in the stupa together with his relics, part of his right forehead and neck bones. During important Buddhist holidays like the coming Makha Bucha, people visit the temple to perform a wian tian candle ceremony. Adherents walk around the stupa three rounds while holding a lit candle and three incense sticks to pay homage to Buddha, his teachings and the enlightened monks. Another old temple that has outstanding architecture is Wat Pong Sanuk Nuea located in Muang district. The highlight is the wooden vihara called Viharn Phrachao Phan Ong. It was built in the form of a pavilion with a three-tiered roof, reflecting the mixed designs of Lanna, Myanmar and Chinese arts. The structure houses four seated Buddha images on a platform and is decorated with a relief of animal sculptures including elephants, nagas, singhs or mythical lions, and eagles on its base. The temple also has a museum that displays a collection of Tripitaka boxes. Be reminded that while wandering in the temple, you may come across some friendly dogs and an unfriendly big black one in the area. Be careful. Before leaving Lampang, don't forget to check out the ceramics, a well-known product of the province. Choices of ceramic factories are plenty including Dhanabadee Ceramic Group, which also has a museum to show visitors the history and process of making ceramic rooster bowls. Another site worth visiting is the Ban Thung Chi Royal Project initiated by HM Queen Sirikit the Queen Mother in 1996. It is located in Muang Pan district, about a 30-minute drive north of the city. The project is open for the public to see every step of ceramic kitchenware production or join a ceramic workshop that can be arranged for group visitors in advance. The site also supports about eight handicraft groups including woodcarving, sewing and weaving. The centre helps create jobs for up to 1,400 people most of whom are from ethnic groups in the area. Their handmade products are available at affordable prices at the souvenir shop inside the royally-initiated project."
18-ก.พ.-21,4:00,Travel,Domestic tourism to surge this year,"Thailand welcomed 6.7 million international visitors last year, according to the Tourism and Sports Ministry. When compared to 2019, the total of international visitors decreased by 83.21% from 39.9 million. Total earnings also dropped by 82% from 1.6 billion baht to 332 million baht. The largest group of visitors were from China (1.25 million tourists), down 88.63% from 10.99 million in 2019. The second-largest group was from Malaysia (619,451 visitors), followed by Russia (587,167), Laos (380,917) and Japan (320,331). Ranking in sixth were visitors from India (261,778), followed by South Korea (260,228), France (236,527), Germany (230,598) and the United Kingdom (221,392). According to the ministry, most of the tourists came during the first quarter of last year, before the country locked down due to Covid-19. As part of restrictions to limit international arrivals during the third and fourth quarters, most visitors were those who had a special tourist visa, business visa, or were part of Thailand Elite card scheme. For this year, the ministry previously forecast that the total number of international tourists would rise to 10 million before revising the target down to 5 million after the second wave of the pandemic in the Kingdom. According to Kasikorn Research Centre, domestic travel will play a crucial role for the tourism industry this year. The centre has forecast that Thais may take 120 million domestic trips, up 39% from last year. The total spending may reach 660 billion baht. However, if things do not turn out as forecast or if the country faces another Covid-19 wave, a new cluster of infections, or a situation that does not lead to total lockdown, Thais may likely take 90 million domestic trips in 2021, up 4.3%. In this case, spending may reach around 500 billion baht.

The reopening last week of Had Hae beach, in tambon Nam Kam, has rejuvenated the local economy. People from all provinces except Samut Sakhon and Pathum Thani can enter this  northeastern river province without 14-day quarantine. However, strict Covid-19 controls are being enforced.  Health officials and volunteers man road checkpoints in all 12 districts of the province, screening the health of travellers. Strict screening is also in place at tourist venues, and this includes visits to Had Hae. The beach normally opens whenever the river level falls, exposing the island, usually from October to May. It is one the province's ""unseen Thailand"" attractions. Local residents and business operators cheered its reopening.  More than 100 stalls selling food and other goods were quickly set up on the beach, and visitors began pouring in, and spending money. Some stall owners said they were taking in more than 10,000 baht a day from selling food and drinks. Khimhan Lamlong, 35, owner of Had Hae restaurant, said he and other local residents were delighted with the reopening of the beach after it had been closed since last year. He said all visitors were required to register their names, wear a face mask and have their body temperature checked. (continues below) ""We are very happy with the reopening of Had Hae. Local people, and especially those who became jobless during the Covid-19 pandemic, can now earn a living,'' said Mr Khimhan. Wiriya Hemnon, 43, of Nam Kam village, said Had Hae was a popular tourist venue and source of income for local residents when the river level falls. Since Covid-19 struck early last year, they had suffered badly. From the New Year to the Songkran festival they could normally take in  20,000-30,000 baht a day. He and other residents had pinned their hopes on the beach being reopened in time for the Songkran festival in April."

12-ก.พ.-21,4:00,Travel,Pioneer in wellness,"Health sanctuary at Chiva-Som Chiva-Som International Health Resort celebrated its quadranscentennial milestone last year as a pioneer in wellness retreats in Thailand. The brainchild of Boonchu Rojanastien, who was a former finance minister and banker, started out as his personal weekend retreat where he went with friends and family to escape from Bangkok's hustle and bustle. From 1995, the beachfront 17.7-rai property has evolved into an internationally renowned wellness destination that has welcomed many A-listers and collected many accolades, including ""Best Destination Spa"" by Condé Nast Traveller The Spa Awards 2020. 25 years in the biz. They must be doing something right. A stay here is more like an experience as you step into a different world where your mindfulness is heightened and your body energised. The open-air reception area overlooks a pond with a colourful school of koi waiting for you to scatter feed for them with a coconut shell ladle. From this point on, the use of your digital devices -- phones, tablets, cameras and the like -- is restricted to within your room and terraces only to ensure privacy and a tranquil vibe. Consider it a digital detox, albeit not cold turkey. After a quick check-in, you'll be transported to your room on a golf buggy while enjoying tall trees, trickling water, manicured bushes and Thai pavilions during the short and pleasant ride. First Impression A wellness journey starts at Health & Wellness Centre where guests have an easy chat with a consultant. Mine asked me about my lifestyle and suggested a tailored programme during my stay. The resort has a weekly schedule with many activities from something mild like tai chi first thing in the morning, real calorie burners like aqua box to mindful activities like Anapanasati mediation. Their health programme is based on six modalities -- spa, fitness, physiotherapy, holistic, nutrition and aesthetics -- so you can imagine that it's quite an info overload but the consultant will help you find what fits you. There are other offerings that aren't included in the schedule and carry an additional fee. The accommodation choices break down into rooms, suites and pavilions across 54 units in total. I stayed at an Ocean Deluxe Room whose terrace looks out to the outdoor swimming pool, Taste of Siam restaurant and the Hua Hin beach. It feels welcoming and spacious with overall wood hues while small details such as healthy snacks, an essential oil burner, morning lime ritual and amenity bag make me feel welcomed further. No need to worry about your daily schedule, though, as its summary will be printed out and neatly placed on the desk. If you want your stay to be more like a sanctuary, opt for a Thai Pavilion where you can enjoy more space, as well as a view of the garden. It's your own weekend home with the addition of an entrance area, an outdoor sala surrounded by greenery and more. Staying In You have 10+ plus daily group activities that you can choose from if you stay from Friday to Sunday so you can easily fill your day with them. During my 2N stay, I started my day with Stress Class at the Yoga Pavilion, which can be more challenging than you think but may also make you realise that you're bendier than you think. A prelude to a more strenuous activity to follow. Aqua Box at Bathing Pavilion really worked up my appetite for lunch as the instructor led the class to execute boxing moves while having most of their bodies submerged in the pool. Another challenging class is Inner Core Exercise in Dance Studio where you strengthen up your abdomen, lower back and hips through various Pilates movements. The overall ambiance of these classes that I attended isn't intimidating at all. My classmates were regular non-model folks so I didn't feel too conscious about my body while the instructors guided us at a regular pace but also gently pushed. If you just want to be pampered, you can book a massage or a treatment at an extra cost. We're talking about a wide range of offers from internal organ massage chi nei tsang, holistic crystal massage to Tecar massage therapy. Ancient to technologically advanced. All meals are served at the beachfront restaurant, Taste of Siam, where wellness cuisine is on offer and definitely was a highlight of my stay. You can enjoy all-you-can-eat healthy goodies to your stomach's content. Despite the restaurant's name, Taste of Siam serves a healthier version of your favourite Thai and international dishes such as Caesar salad, Australian beef steak with cauliflower puree (instead of heavier mash), creme brulee with couscous, som tam and pla neung manao, but not at the expense of flavour. As part of checking out, I met with the wellness consultant again to check on my progress and learned that I dropped 3kg in about two days, but mainly due to the low-sodium diet from Taste of Siam. A lot of salt causes your body to retain more water. The more you know. Final Verdict If you have any trepidation with the word ""wellness retreat"", I can assure you that Chiva-Som doesn't feel like a boot camp at all. It's a tranquil getaway during which you pay more attention to your body and mind and learn wellness tips that you apply to your everyday life afterward. Chiva-Som can help jump-start a healthier you. To celebrate the month of love, Chiva-Som offers All-Inclusive Wellness Vacations that come with a long list of perks, including one treatment per person per night of stay, a physical analysis and full board plus afternoon tea. Those who take advantage of this offer, also get -- subject to availability -- 10am early check-in, room upgrade and lunch upon arrival. Rates start from B12,500 net per person per night for double occupancy and B14,500 per person per night for single occupancy. They go down to B9,500 and B11,500 respectively with the Rao Tiew Duay Gun discounts applied. This offer is valid for stays until the end of the month.

1-มี.ค.-21,9:30,Tech,Apple privacy moves to kneecap Facebook revenue,"The upcoming iOS 14 update will give users the option to choose which apps have their personal information Most mobile users may not be aware some apps installed on their devices are tracking them across websites and other apps for targeted advertising, but the upcoming roll-out of Apple's iOS 14 operating system could potentially disrupt the practice as it would notify users and allow them to decide if they will allow tracking of their digital footprints. This update complies with Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy protection framework. Many users are expected to opt out of the tracking option when they receive a notification from the system for personal data privacy. The iOS 14 system sends a pop-up to users, alerting them the apps track their digital footprints, with an option to refuse the tracking. Apple said the move is being made in the name of privacy. This practice has drawn the ire of some renowned apps, particularly Facebook, which could be at risk of losing a huge chunk of revenue from targeted ads. According to Statista, a statistics website, Facebook generated US$84.2 billion in advertising revenue worldwide in 2020. This makes up almost the entirety of the total revenue of $86 billion the company reported last year. In response to Apple's move, Facebook stated scores of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are reliant on social media ads to draw customers, and could be at risk of faltering if the move comes into effect. Snap Inc, owner of popular photo-messaging app Snapchat, has also expressed concerns about Apple's move, saying it could pose a risk to advertiser demand. The global trend is shifting towards personal data protection and privacy. This could make it tougher for apps and platforms to freely make use of customer data for their personal gains. Thailand's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), which will be fully enforced this June, also hinders targeted online ads. Digital marketers and SMEs have been advised to adapt quickly to this trend and related regulations. DEATH OF COOKIES ""We are moving into the era of what we call 'Cookie Crumble', or some say 'Death of Cookies',"" said Maureen Tan, chief executive of advertising agency Wunderman Thompson Bangkok. ""The latest announcement from Apple on ATT is not new, but it makes the privacy rights of its users a priority."" Google announced last year it will no longer support third-party cookies by 2022 for Chrome. Some browsers today such as Safari and Mozilla Firefox already do not support third-party cookies. According to Ms Tan, ATT will hurt Facebook the most. Facebook relies heavily on understanding what a user does outside of its app to market a user relevant ads on Facebook, she said. ""With ATT on iOS, Facebook's ability to be 'intelligent' and hyper-targeted will be affected,"" said Ms Tan. Google should be less affected by ATT as the majority of Google's ad revenue comes from search results pages, where a search query is presented with organic search results and relevant ads, she said. According to Ms Tan, 73% of mobile users in Thailand use Android devices and 15% use the iOS system. Facebook and Google still see the lion's share of advertisements spent on their platforms in Thailand. Non-Facebook and Google ad spending is not as high. Whether the advertiser is a big company or small SME that markets frequently on Facebook or Google Display Network, the larger effect will come from the 15% of mobile owners who use iOS, she said. ""This means the ability to be razor sharp in targeting and re-targeting will slowly and surely be towards this 15% of iOS users,"" said Ms Tan. EFFECTS FROM ATT She said there are four aspects to the ATT impact on iOS users. First, apps and programmatic placements across the open web will see a drop in targeting power and control, which will eventually create inefficiencies and poorer ad personalisation. More work needs to be done to reach the right audiences on iOS, especially on platforms like Facebook, said Ms Tan. Second, personalising advertisements will become tougher and will deprive marketers of key data on the performance of advertising campaigns, she said. Third, the results of ad spend on Facebook will be more estimated for reach, impressions and conversions among iOS users that Facebook cannot track in coming future. ""Finally, look-alike audiences on Facebook may also be affected as the custom audiences you are capturing on iOS may not be as accurate anymore,"" Ms Tan said. Apple's ATT should have a snowball effect, with other tech giants following suit at some point, she said. There will soon be a ""morale"" debate and a big focus on bringing back users' data privacy rights through concrete actions, said Ms Tan. ""This is a sure predictor that the death of cookies will fundamentally change how online advertising works,"" she said. FAST ADAPTATION NEEDED Ms Tan said marketers who have long relied on Facebook and other tech giants need to be prepared for the short- and long-term effects from ATT. ""It is now time to adapt fast,"" she said. ""If brands have their own apps in Apple Store, pop-up notifications to seek consent should be planned for immediately."" Marketers may also need to revisit other strategies, said Ms Tan. ""Strategies such as contextual advertising may be the real comeback kid with ATT in place,"" she said. ""Contextual targeting is a form of personalised advertising that enables your Google pay-per-click ads to appear on relevant sites."" Another solution is businesses may need to collect data themselves. ""This is the time to build a real connection with your customers as you would if you own a single shop where the shopowner knows you by name, your interests and preferences,"" Ms Tan said. She said there are still plenty of platforms that can integrate and collect data from multiple channels into a cohesive system, and businesses can make use of them. CUSTOMER DATA OWNERSHIP Pawat Ruangdejworachai, president of the Media Intelligence Group (MI), a media planning and creative agency, said Apple's ATT, Google Chrome's data policy as well as the PDPA could hinder the growth of Thailand's digital market advertisement spending. New policies and features may hamper the accuracy of targeted audiences, whose information includes gender, age and location. Large corporations who have their own customer databases can leverage existing data to analyse and decide their own advertisement spending plans. But SMEs, who do not have their own customer database or big money to spend, could be hit the hardest. ""During this time, local SMEs may need to collect and own customer data themselves rather than merely relying on social media platforms for advertising,"" said Mr Pawat. The PDPA is a point of concern for digital marketers because the use of targeted ads could be a breach of the law, he said. According to Mr Pawat, marketers may need to focus on some targeted groups on social networks for advertising as they can reach their targets directly. For example, marketers may find a group dedicated to luxury watches on social media and they can engage with them. This group could also lead to other high-end segments, such as luxury cars and property. Marketers may choose websites that contain niche content for targeted groups and place banners to reach them. Brands can also make use of influencers to communicate with their specific targets, he said. PRIVACY PARADOX Prinya Hom-anek, a cybersecurity expert, said the war between Facebook and Apple reflects a personal data privacy paradox. Apple is giving greater emphasis to user privacy and designing its system to ensure user data protection. But technology is progressing quickly and it is becoming hard for humans to catch up and protect their own data, he said. Referring to PDPA compliance, Mr Prinya said many executives and people may look at it as a cost, but the law is meant to ensure personal data is properly protected. By complying with the PDPA, it can help ward off data leakage, helping the reputations of businesses, he said. ""Complying with the PDPA is an investment, not a cost,"" said Mr Prinya. Paiboon Amonpinyokeat, a managing partner at P&P Law Firm, said Apple's move on consumer data protection shows it has the potential to comply with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation as well as the PDPA. After the PDPA is fully enforced, Facebook and audio-based social networking app Clubhouse would have to receive consent from users to comply with the law, otherwise they could face punishment for violating the PDPA, he said. ""Foreign firms based outside of Thailand that collect and exchange personal data in the country are also subject to the PDPA,"" said Mr Paiboon. Panutat Tejasen, better known as Dr Jimmy, a tech entrepreneur and software developer, said ATT should be beneficial for consumers, but detrimental to Facebook. The move regresses the ad environment back to the pre-Facebook period, when advertisers themselves needed to figure out ways to reach out to their targets, he said. Chalee Asavathiratham, chief digital banking officer at Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), said the bank announced a privacy notice on storing, using and disclosing the personal information of customers in May 2020. Customers have to provide consent for SCB to use this data to provide services and develop new features. SCB has been preparing to comply with the PDPA through SCB Easy, the bank's mobile application, by embedding a feature on data privacy management whereby customers can accept or decline the bank's permission to access personal data, said Mr Chalee."

Smart home assistants such as Amazon's Alexa have found success worldwide, but tech firms in Japan are reporting huge demand for more humanlike alternatives, as people seek solace during coronavirus isolation.

Yamaha, which makes Charlie, describes it as ""more chatty than a pet, but less work than a lover"". ""He is there for me to chat with as someone other than family, or friends on social networks, or a boss I needed to produce a report for,"" Hamaura told AFP. She is a pre-launch test customer for Charlie, which Yamaha plans to release later this year. ""Charlie, tell me something interesting,"" she asks while typing at her dining table. ""Well, well... balloons burst when you spray lemon juice!"" he replies, cheerfully tilting his head to each side. - Robots with character - Sharp said sales of its small humanoid Robohon were up 30% in the three months to September 2020 compared with a year earlier. ""Not only families with children, but also seniors in their 60s and 70s"" are snapping up Robohon, which talks, dances and is also a working phone, a Sharp spokesman told AFP. But the adorable android -- first released in 2016 and only available in Japan -- does not come cheap, with regular models priced between US$820 and $2,250. Charlie and Robohon are part of a new wave of robot companions pioneered by firms such as Sony with its robot dog Aibo, on sale since 1999, and SoftBank's friendly Pepper, which hit shelves in 2015. ""Many Japanese people accept the idea that every object has a soul,"" said Shunsuke Aoki, CEO of robot firm Yukai Engineering. ""They want a robot to have a character, like a friend, family or a pet -- not a mechanical function like a dishwasher."" Yukai's robots include Qoobo, a fluffy pillow with a mechanical tail that wiggles like a real pet. They will soon release their latest home assistant ""Bocco emo"", which looks like a miniature snowman and allows families to leave and send voice messages through their phones. (continues below) Kaori Takahashi, 32, bought a Yukai robot-building kit for her six-year-old son to keep him occupied during the pandemic. Robots feel normal in everyday life because they are in so many Japanese children's films and cartoons, she said. ""I grew up watching anime shows 'The Astro Boy Essays' and 'Doraemon', which both feature robots, and my children love them too."" - 'Heartwarming' - Studies have shown that therapeutic robot pets designed in Japan, such as fluffy mechanical seals, can bring comfort to dementia patients. But the makers of Lovot -- a robot the size of a small toddler, with big round eyes and penguin-like wings that flutter up and down -- think everyone can benefit from a bot that just wants to be loved. It has more than 50 sensors and an internal heating system, making it warm to touch, which it reacts to with squeaks of joy. (continues below) Manufacturer Groove X said monthly sales shot up more than tenfold after the coronavirus hit Japan. A single Lovot costs around $2,800, plus fees for maintenance and software -- but those without deep pockets can visit the ""Lovot Cafe"" near Tokyo instead. One customer there, 64-year-old Yoshiko Nakagawa, called out to one of the robots fondly by name, as if to a grandson. During Japan's virus state of emergency, the capital became ""stark and empty"", she said. ""We need time to heal ourselves after this bleak period. If I had one of these babies at home, the heartwarming feeling would probably do the trick."
26-ก.พ.-21,10:45,Tech,Twitter planning to charge users for special content,"SAN FRANCISCO: Twitter said on Thursday it plans to offer a subscription service in which users would pay for special content from high-profile accounts, part of an economic model to diversify its revenue. The globally popular social media platform announced the potential new Super Follows service at its annual investor meeting, as it searches for new revenue streams beyond targeted advertising. ""Exploring audience funding opportunities like Super Follows will allow creators and publishers to be directly supported by their audience and will incentivize them to continue creating content that their audience loves,"" a Twitter spokesperson told AFP. Top Twitter executives discussed Super Follows while outlining goals and plans for the near future during the streamed presentation. ""We are examining and rethinking the incentives of our service -- the behaviors that our product features encourage and discourage as people participate in conversation on Twitter,"" the spokesperson said. Super Follows was described during the presentation as a way for Twitter audiences to financially support creators and receive newsletters, exclusive content and even virtual badges in exchange. Twitter, which currently makes money from ads and promoted posts, might be able to add additional revenue via the Super Follows transactions. Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi was not convinced people will be inclined to pay for special content on Twitter. Such a model makes sense for content on platforms like YouTube, where hours of craftsmanship might be devoted to producing entertaining videos, but it is debatable whether the same could be said for tweets on Twitter, she said. No timeline was given for when Super Follows might become a feature, but it is expected that the tech giant will make further announcements in the coming months. - Building communities - Twitter is also considering allowing users to join communities devoted to topics via a feature seemingly similar to Facebook's ""groups."" Twitter aims to reach a milestone of 315 million ""monetizable"" users in 2023, a steep increase from the 192 million it had at the end of last year, according to a filing with US financial markets regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission. The San Francisco-based firm defined monetizable users as people who log in daily and can be shown ads. Twitter, like Google and Facebook, makes most of its money from digital advertising. The company said it is aiming for $7.5 billion in revenue in 2023, more than double the $3.7 billion it took in last year. Twitter also plans to double ""development velocity,"" meaning the number of new features it releases per employee to get people to engage more with the service. - Apple bite? - Twitter revenue product lead Bruce Falck told analysts that the tech company was mindful of a potential crimp in revenue that could be caused by new privacy labels Apple is mandating for apps on its mobile devices. App makers are concerned that the labels will discourage users from allowing collection of data used to more effectively target ads. ""It's still too early to tell exactly how this will impact the industry, but it will be felt by the entire industry,"" Falck said, adding that Twitter was innovating to soften the blow. Twitter's plan to boost revenue also includes getting more involved in online commerce. ""Imagine easily discovering and quickly purchasing a new skincare product, or trendy sneaker from a brand new follow with only a few clicks,"" a Twitter executive told analysts. An area where Twitter is additionally looking to make money is Fleets, a recently added feature where posts and conversations vanish after a day. "
26-ก.พ.-21,10:30,Tech,Drones using AI to track rare Maui dolphins,"WELLINGTON: The New Zealand's government said on Friday that it was backing a new project that uses drone technology to understand and protect the country's extremely rare and endangered Maui dolphins. Maui dolphins live in a small stretch of ocean off the west coast of New Zealand's North Island and current estimates suggest that only 63 dolphins older than one year remain, raising concerns that they may soon become extinct. The new Maui Drone Project is a one-year collaboration between the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI), non-profit wildlife technology organisation Maui63 and WWF-New Zealand. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is capable of finding and tracking Maui dolphins using artificial intelligence. The technology has the potential to compile detailed data on the habitats, population size and distribution and behaviour of the dolphins, along with many other types of marine species such as other dolphins, seabirds, and whales, officials said. ""There has been unfortunately for many years disputes over how to best protect Maui  dolphins,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said after announcing the initiative, adding that the government has stepped in to fund the project and help protect the dolphins. ""But we need everyone to come together."" Fishing companies Moana New Zealand and Sanford Limited are also supporting the project. The government has already moved to restrict fishing around the areas Maui  dolphins frequent.“By advancing our understanding of how Maui dolphins behave during the day and throughout the year this project will help us ensure the measures our government has already put in place to protect our Maui dolphins are robust and appropriate,” said Oceans and Fisheries Minister David Parker. The drone ensures dolphins remain undisturbed as they fly at an altitude of over 120 metres.  "
26-ก.พ.-21,9:03,Tech,DTAC aims to woo migrants,"Incentives target foreign workforce Total Access Communication (DTAC), the country's third largest mobile operator by subscribers, is deepening its focus on migrant workers from Myanmar and Cambodia through the use of incentives, including online pharmacy vouchers, in a bid to gain a strong foothold in this huge market. DTAC chief marketing officer How Lih Ren said the incentives are being provided because the company recognises the special requirements of people from Myanmar and Cambodia, who make up the majority of foreign workers in Thailand, representing around 90% of the country's total migrant workforce. It is estimated there are around 2.3 million migrant workers in Thailand. They were responsible for contributing around 4-6% of the country's GDP in 2019. According to Mr How, nationals of Myanmar and Cambodia using DTAC SIM cards can purchase special vouchers for 59 baht and 89 baht, which can be used to purchase goods to the value of 100 baht and 200 baht, respectively, at participating pharmacies. User can dial a number provided in order to receive the coupon via SMS, which can then be presented at one of the participating pharmacies. Among the company's other incentives are a 1G on-top internet package available for just 10 baht. DTAC now has Burmese- and Cambodian-language apps which ensure all customers can receive the same fast, secure and rewarding experience, said Mr How. According to Mr How, DTAC's data suggests the pandemic has had an impact on migrant workers' mobile usage. In 2020, their data consumption surged 15% per person per day when compared with the previous year. The most popular apps among migrants are Facebook, YouTube, Line, Messenger and TikTok. Mr How said the company is committed to serving its migrant customers through three core strategies: connectivity, convenience and comfort. ""Our migrant customers expect great voice and data services for their local usage and to stay connected with their loved ones back home,"" said Mr How. ""DTAC goes one step further with online and offline channels in Burmese and Cambodian, and by providing special offers designed specifically to meet their needs."" The launch of DTAC's Burmese-language app will address social distancing by providing network enhancements for migrant communities and a more affordable daily essential internet top-up to support their growing need for connectivity. Mr How said network sites have also been added to areas close to migrant communities and workplaces. Broadening the reach of DTAC's services can reduce migrants' cost of living and improve their healthcare access."
27-ก.พ.-21,4:00,Tech,Xiaomi steps up Thai investment,"Despite the economic stalemate, Chinese tech giant Xiaomi has vowed to double its investment in marketing and sharpen its focus on 5G-enabled smartphones to become a top three vendor in Thailand. ""Thailand is a very important market in Southeast Asia. The country has energetic consumers, such as youngsters, the rise of 5G-enabled smartphone adoption and the growth of e-commerce,"" said K.M. Leong, general manager for Southeast Asia of Xiaomi International. The overall economic situation will get better and smartphone innovation with 5G and attractive prices could accelerate consumer replacement, he said. Xiaomi plans to double its marketing investment in Thailand this year, said Mr Leong. By this year, the firm plans to expand its Mi Stores from 30 to 100, retail partners from 4,000 to 8,000 and after-sales service centres from 12 to 25. Xiaomi expects to have a call centre service in the Thai language by March, pick-up points by April and a door-to-door service by May, he said. In the third quarter of last year, Xiaomi attained a 11% market share or the fourth in the Thai market, according to research firm Canalys. ""We aim to become one of the top three in the market as soon as possible,"" said Mr Leong. Despite the challenging situation of the pandemic, Xiaomi's sales grew three times in Thailand as it provides innovative products at affordable prices and leverages e-commerce channels that can offset the closure of shops during the lockdown. ""We will bring more 5G-enabled smartphones to the market, particularly premium models, at competitive prices, as well as roll out new Internet of Things products -- at least one a month -- on top of the 200 IoT items that have been launched,"" Mr Leong.To continue its 5G-enabled high-end smartphones, the company has introduced the Mi11 smartphone powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 -- the most powerful smartphone chipset from Qualcomm to date. The handset also comes with a triple camera set-up offering peak resolution at 108MP, studio-level audio recording system and 50W of wireless charging."
26-ก.พ.-21,4:00,Tech,Get social,"Alternative apps to build a community It's 2009. Barack Obama was sworn in as US president. Protesters are on the street (different protesters though, not like the ones protesting now). Your iPod contains hits like Boom Boom Pow, I'm Yours and even though you hide it, you also listen to that new blonde girl's song called Love Story because it's a bop. And then there's this new thing called Facebook that people seem to be using more and more. You don't know if you're willing to give up your pimped out Hi5 profile complete with a glittery background and a MP3 player loaded with Big Ass' Len Kaung Soong but you decide to give it a shot. More than 10 years and a number of privacy issues later, you're still using Facebook along with a number of other social networking apps, but perhaps you may be looking for other ways to build a community and meet new people. Perhaps you want to meet like-minded people like you who share you love for entrepreneurship or memes, and maybe you even want to get on platforms that will actually make you some dough. Facebook isn't your only avenue. We've got you sorted on where else you can build or find a community that's right for you. CLUBHOUSE Available in iOS The Apple-exclusive app has recently gained popularity in the past few weeks. But while you may be seeing a bunch of people posting on their feeds about the new networking app, there might still be a few of you who are confused as to what it actually is. Its description in the App Store touts it as a ""space for casual, drop-in audio conversations"". It's like you're listening to a live podcast. Wait a minute, didn't we have this sort of thing before? You know, when people talk live but it's only audio and you usually listen from your car, and they even play music sometimes? PROS While it is funny to think that we've basically gone full-circle from radios to an app that sort of lets us listen to various radio talkshows, the big difference is that anyone can host a room to talk about anything. That means you could host a room and talk about anything mundane or someone like Elon Musk could host a room and talk with the CEO of the Robinhood app (yes, the very same app Redditors used to save GameStop) and even field questions. In fact, it's Musk's appearance that put the app's popularity over the top. The app's exclusivity doesn't just stop at the fact that it's invite-only and limited to Apple, but its rooms permanently close once the conversation is done. You can't go back and listen to it days later. If you want to join a room and listen to the conversation, you would have to catch it while it's live, kinda like what we used to do with radios. Like I said, full-circle. CONS Clubhouse's exclusivity means that only a limited number of people can access it, namely owners of Apple devices and people who actually have friends who can send them an invite. The latter part may not be too difficult though. Within a minute or so of posting on my FB that I was looking for an invite, a friend sent me one, so there's a good chance someone in your circle can hook you up. However, its exclusivity may also be the only reason why it's become popular. There's nothing like feeling you're part of some ""special"" group because you have access to an invite-only app, but that might be the only thing Clubhouse will have going for it. Remember Vero? And if you don't, that's exactly my point. BLOCKDIT Available in iOS and Android Blockdit is an app made by Thai developers that looks like a version of FB at first glance. However, spend a few minutes on it and you'll realise that Blockdit offers an interesting take on networking. Plus, you could even get monetised on it. PROS On Blockdit, you don't add friends. Instead, you follow pages that would interest you, whether it's a content creator, a business or a page that caters to a certain topic. It's the starting point of building a feed that's catered to your liking without the clutter of personal posts, your grandma sharing fake news or your cousin's really edgy and dark memes. The developers want the app to be the breeding ground of ideas not just by connecting with others but also encouraging you to share your own. You can make different types of posts like an article, a video, a podcast or you can link a number of posts as a ""series"". And of course, as previously mentioned, you can actually earn from your Blockdit page, and it's not even that difficult to get monetised since all you need is 1,000 followers. CONS Blockdit has gotten gained popularity among Thai people but if you're a foreigner that doesn't read Thai, finding pages in English that you can follow may be next to impossible. Right now, the platform seems to have a majority of Thai content with the only English content being about English tutorials or learning grammar. TWITCH Twitch.tv / Available on iOS and Android Twitch is to gaming what ESPN is to sports. The concept of watching other people playing video games was considered ludicrous by many when it was first introduced, but Twitch gave early streamers a platform back in 2011 which then grew to become a legitimate means of earning money and the rise of E-sports. Now, it's home to a big number of partnered channels, each of whom have their own subscribers that amount to thousands. PROS Much like anything nowadays, streaming on Twitch isn't difficult. For example, if you've got a PS4, there's an option for you to broadcast directly to your account. Setting up a stream on PC may require more steps but it's not too complicated. What does require some grinding is getting some viewers, and the same goes if you want to become a Twitch affiliate i.e. you want to make money off your streams. But even then, the requirement isn't too crazy and is definitely attainable as long as you work at it. If you're stumped as to what content you want to stream, don't sweat it. Browse through the numerous channels on the platform and you'll realise that there's a vast amount of content -- and some of it isn't even gaming. If you're just a casual viewer then the aforementioned treasure trove of channels and content will surely give you a streamer that can entertain you and that you can also support and follow. CONS If you're striving to build a community and a rep as a streamer on multiple platforms and not just on Twitch, this may become problematic once you've joined their affiliate programme. Once your stream ends, that content is exclusively on Twitch for 24 hours and violating this by posting clips of it anywhere else like YT and IG is a violation of your affiliate agreement. Twitch also takes a cut from what you get from subscriptions but then again, they are your middle man in this. TIKTOK Available on iOS and Android Oh, TikTok. What's left to say that hasn't already been said? Much like the disdain aimed against people who make a living off streaming, the idea that people could make money off TikTok was considered ridiculous at first -- that is, until people actually started making serious dough off the following they gained from the app. Aside from that, people also worried that the app, which originated from China, was stealing personal information (as if Facebook hadn't already done that), so much so that an actual head of state tried to ban it from his own country. Nevertheless, TikTok has become a source of entertainment and an avenue to make unlikely friends across the globe. PROS As a casual viewer of the Tok, content to keep yourself entertained and occupied is endless -- and I do mean endless. I've found myself scrolling through my feed and For You Page for hours on end. If you're looking to be a content creator, its set-up is simple enough that anyone can shoot and edit videos. Because of the rise of the app's popularity, a lot of people have made TikTok an essential part in building a following and community so if that's your goal and you're not on the Tok yet, you better get on it. CONS If you're looking to build a following on the app and trying to figure out its algorithm to get more views and likes, that's going to be a doozy. The simplest way to explain it is that it's a lottery -- there's no telling which of your videos will get views, likes or shares. There are even times you might get ""shadowbanned"" which is when TikTok doesn't show your videos to anyone, which sucks especially if you barely have any followers. The best thing you can do is keep creating content. Oh, and Uncle Tu is on it, apparently. Ugh. DISCORD Available on iOS and Android If you haven't heard of Discord then it may be because you're not a gamer or perhaps you're... seasoned in years. Originally intended to be an instant messaging and voice chat app for gamers who are unsatisfied with in-game voice chat, Discord has become the IM of choice for many especially for those who are millennials or younger. PROS Remember when Zoom skyrocketed in popularity when the pandemic hit? Well, Discord was already being used for video chat with more than two people well before then. Discord's video chat seems to be smoother as well compared to other apps although a limit of 25 people can join a video/audio chat channel. Speaking of channels, that's how Discord works: instead of just one group chat where everything is jumbled, you can make servers with different channels for different topics to get organised. For example, if you want to make a server for you and your friends, you can make different channels each dedicated to study, memes or just random stuff. In other words, Discord makes group chats easier. Plus, there are many servers you can join. You can explore the different servers that are open to the public on the app. Most streamers nowadays have their very own Discord server so if you're looking for one to join, that's a good place to look at first. CONS Discord has a premium subscription called Nitro which gives the subscriber certain perks like a custom tag and emojis as well as the ability to ""boost a server"". To be honest, these are perks you wouldn't really care about if you're just going to use Discord for communication purposes. However, one big impediment non-Nitro subscribers do face is that Discord won't allow you to upload files on the app that are bigger than 8MB. Meanwhile, Nitro subscribers can upload up to 100MB. It's the only annoying thing about using the app. REDDIT Reddit.com / Available on iOS and Android Reddit has been around for a long time but it definitely deserves to be on this list. With countless subreddits that range from the completely ridiculous to the somewhat dark, it's impossible you don't find a community on here. PROS Because of its subreddits galore, almost every topic you could think of from dank memes to screenplay advice to the PC Master Race is covered in Reddit. Thailand even has its own subreddit, aptly named r/Thailand, where posts range from latest news to the ridiculous signs users discover all around the country. Reddit's foundation is interaction: you're encouraged to post and comment so that you get upvotes and increase your ""karma"", which is basically an approximate measure of votes your submissions got. ""Does karma win you anything?"" I hear you ask. Well... no. Bragging rights, I guess? CONS Because of its huge number of subreddits, there's bound to be NSFW or ""not safe for work"" content. And no, I don't just mean of the ""intimate relations"" variety but actually disturbing content. I won't name any specific subreddits, but a Google search of the darkest ones will give you a good idea of what can be found in the darkest corners of Reddit. Consider yourself warned."

The company's board on Tuesday appointed president Watchai Vilailuck executive vice-chairman in charge of corporate strategy and new business development. He will be replaced by Teerachai Phongpanangam, executive vice-president in charge of utilities and transport. The board also approved executive vice-chairman Thananan Vilailuck as executive chairman. This appointment will be effective from March 1. Mr Watchai called the reshuffle a ""normal"" practice as the company has a policy of supporting internal candidates for promotion in their fields. The firm has a clear succession plan in place to ensure its business is streamlined efficiently and continuously. ""This also fosters a sense of ownership among executives and the next generation of employees,"" he said. Mr Watchai said now is the appropriate time for him to move to the new position to explore and create new businesses for the firm. He said Mr Teerachai, who has been with Samart for more than 20 years, is an experienced, capable man for president and his past achievements have been guaranteed.According to Mr Watchai, Samart is gearing up for the business-to-government-to-consumer model with solutions put forward for state agencies and state enterprises to ensure better services for the public.The model which focuses on the ""all win"" principle will be beneficial to the public, state and private sectors, he said. ""The company is also focusing on developing new business solutions and mobile applications to catch up with the global trend and investing in interesting startups,"" he said.""I believe we have passed through the hard time and now it is the time to recover and create business foundations for the company's sustainability."" The company reported revenue of 9.49 billion baht in 2020, down 33.5% from the year before.Revenue from sales, contracted work and services fell 35.6% year-on-year to 9.1 billion baht.The decline was attributed to the impact of the pandemic on ICT solutions and services as well as utilities and transportation business."
24-ก.พ.-21,9:35,Tech,"SolarWinds hack required massive, sophisticated effort - Microsoft president","WASHINGTON: The stunning SolarWinds hack that cybersecurity experts blame on Russia likely took a massive, disciplined effort by more than 1,000 software engineers, Microsoft President Brad Smith said Tuesday. Smith told a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee that no other body but Russian intelligence has the ability to muster such an effort, which he branded ""reckless"" in the breadth of its threat to the globe. Microsoft, one of more than 100 companies attacked and 18,000 left vulnerable by the hack, analyzed the work it took to insert malware into widely used security software created by SolarWinds. ""We asked ourselves how many engineers do we believe had worked on this collective effort. And the answer we came to was... at least 1,000, very skilled, capable engineers. ""We haven't seen this kind of sophistication matched with this kind of scale,"" he said. Smith compared previous hacks from Russian- and other government-backed groups to a burglar breaking into a single apartment. The SolarWinds incident was different, he said: it was like a burglar who ""manages to turn off the alarm system for every home and every building in the entire city."" ""Everybody's safety is put at risk. And that is what we're grappling with here,"" he said. The hack was discovered by computer security firm FireEye in December after it had sat on computers around the world. Among US government agencies penetrated were the National Security Agency, the State Department, Commerce Department and the Treasury. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the Biden administration was studying options to Punish Moscow for the hack and for other ""malign"" activity. Last week Anne Neuberger, the senior White House cybersecurity advisor, said her team was looking ""holistically"" at retaliation. ""This isn't the only case of malicious cyber activity of likely Russian origin, either for us or for our allies and partners,"" she said. In the Senate hearing, FireEye chief executive Kevin Mandia described the hack as the culmination of a ""multi-decade"" effort by the attackers. He said it took thousands of hours for his staff to discover the bug, and only after tearing apart and decompiling thousands of files on a SolarWinds server. ""This was not the first place you look, this was the last place you look for an insertion,"" he said. Sudhakar Ramakrishna, the chief executive of SolarWinds, said that after months the company still has not found how the hackers managed to implant malware in the middle of the software supply chain -- at the point when completed code is being tailored to downstream users' configurations. ""We understand the gravity of the situation,"" he said. In the hearing, both tech company officials and lawmakers said the breadth of the SolarWinds hack showed there needs to be a mandatory reporting system for companies discovering they have been penetrated by hackers. While currently companies can voluntarily report to the cybersecurity officials of the Department of Homeland Security, some suggested a legal requirement that they do so, to catch future threats early. ""It seems to me that there should be an obligation of some sort on the part of a victim of a cyber attack like this to share what they know, what they've learned, with the appropriate authorities,"" said Senator John Cornyn. ""There's got to be a way for folks who are responding to breaches to share data quickly to protect the nation, protect industries,"" said Mandia."
24-ก.พ.-21,4:00,Tech,Most large firms seen using AI by 2025,"By 2025, 97% of large companies globally will make use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology while 60% of global carrier revenue will come from industrial customers, says Ken Hu, deputy chairman of global tech powerhouse Huawei Technologies. He was speaking at the opening ceremony of Mobile World Congress Shanghai 2021, an online and offline forum hosted by Huawei under the theme of ""Connected for Shared Prosperity"". Some 55% of China's GDP will be driven by the digital economy as opportunities abound in digital transformation, he noted. All industries should focus on improving their capabilities, building out the ecosystem and creating value with digital technology, he said. According to Mr Hu, there is concern about the world facing K-shaped economic recovery in the post Covid-19 period with an increasingly wide divide between organisations and people who benefit from digital technology and those who do not. K-shaped recovery means different sections of an economy recover at substantially different rates. In order to avoid unbalanced development, bridge the digital divide and promote inclusive growth, the focus of innovation needs to shift to producing greater social value, he said. ""Innovation isn't just about solving the challenges we face today, but about lighting up tomorrow,"" Mr Hu said. ""Once we get the pandemic under control, we need to think hard about how we can innovate to improve the quality of life, make businesses smarter and create a more inclusive world."" According to Mr Hu, the pandemic has created many requirements for digital infrastructure, adding 5G, cloud and AI have begun to play an important role in manufacturing, speeding up the transition to more intelligent and flexible operations. Huawei uses 5G innovation to help drive the digital transformation of all industries, especially through technology, products and applications. Last year, Huawei worked closely with carriers to ensure the stable operations of more than 300 networks across 170 countries. In Indonesia, Huawei employed new digital delivery technology to rapidly deploy over 50,000 base stations. In Ningxia province in northern China, Huawei's integrated routers enable multi-cloud access for enterprise users, helping them move to cloud more rapidly and at lower costs. Mr Hu said the firm is also working with partners to explore how 5G can assist different industries in attaining digital achievement. Mr Hu also showed the audience at the event Huawei's Cyberverse app, an advanced augmented reality app that shows how 5G network, 5G devices and AR technology can converge to create a more immersive virtual experience. Huawei expects Cyberverse to create new growth opportunities in multiple sectors, including education, entertainment, tourism, transportation and navigation. ""While the pandemic closed many doors, innovation has opened new windows of hope,"" Mr Hu said."
26-ก.พ.-21,4:00,Property,L.P.N. set to focus on low-rise projects,"With a huge quantity of condo stock in hand, SET-listed developer L.P.N. Development Plc plans to rent out unsold units and focus on low-rise housing development, expected to be the key driver for revenue growth in 2021-24. Chief executive and managing director Opas Sripayak said the company has unsold condo inventory worth 15 billion baht, of which 9 billion represented completed units. ""We will rent out these completed units to generate a recurring income during an oversupply in the condo market,"" he said. ""We will also offer tenants these units for purchase which could be transferred in the future or when tenants are ready to secure them. The monthly rents they pay will become monthly instalments once they decide to buy the rental unit."" He said this offer will benefit those who were unemployed or struggling to get a mortgage loan during the pandemic, such as those working in the aviation or hospitality industry. Last year the company rented out 200-300 units at Lumpini Park Phahol 32, a 2-billion-baht condo project with 546 units on Phahon Yothin Soi 32 which were completed in 2019 and had 80% of units remaining unsold. He said the Phahol 32 units were the result of a condo glut. Its average prices were 130,000-140,000 baht per square metre or more than 3 million baht a unit. Buyers had the same choices in more attractive locations such as Asoke or Sukhumvit road. ""We will not cut prices to boost sales for this project if discounted prices still remain unattractive to draw buyers,"" he said. ""Lowering prices should occur at an appropriate level,"" he said. Other completed condo projects with a large number of unsold units included Lumpini Township Rangsit-Klong 1 Phase 2, which was completed in 2016 and had 36% of 3,674 units remaining unsold. There were two projects in Cha-am that had a sales rate of only 31%. They were completed in 2018. Last year L.P.N. had additional completed unsold supply from four newly-completed projects including Lumpini Place Rama 3-Riverine with 73% and Lumpini Ville Sukhumvit 101/1-Punnawithi with 71%. The other two were Lumpini Park Boromarajonani-Sirindhorn with 68% remaining and Lumpini Ville Pattanakarn-Srinakarin with 52%. As it had a large condo inventory and 6-8 land plots for condo development to be launched in the future, it will spend a total budget of 4 billion baht this year only for low-rise housing projects worth 8 billion baht to develop in the future. L.P.N. aims to have 7.5 billion baht, 9.45 billion baht, 12.3 billion baht and 16 billion baht in revenue during the years 2021-24, respectively. A key driver will be low-rise houses which will rise from 2.2 billion baht this year to 2.8 billion baht, 4.5 billion baht and 7 billion baht during the years 2022-24, respectively. Recurring income from services and rents will grow from 1.35 billion baht last year to 1.5 billion baht, 1.65 billion baht, 1.8 billion baht and 2 billion baht during the years 2021-24, respectively. Revenue from condos is estimated at 3.8 billion baht, 5 billion baht, 6 billion baht and 7 billion baht during the years 2021-24, respectively. 2024 will see half of revenue from condo and low-rise houses. This year it will launch nine new projects worth a combined 8.5 billion baht. Six of them will be low-rise houses worth 5.5 billion baht. Two of three condo projects will be on Charan Sanit Wong Soi 22 and Narathiwat-Ratchada. L.P.N. reported 7.36 billion baht in revenue last year, down 26% from 10 billion in 2019. Revenue from property development was 6 billion baht and the rest from recurring income including 1.13 billion from property management and 225 million baht from services and rents, which rose by 6.8% and 30% respectively. Net profit declined by 43% to 716 million baht from 1.25 billion baht. Net profit margin also decreased to 9.6% from 12.5% as gross profit dropped to 30.8% from 32.7%. Presales last year hit 10.4 billion baht, up 23% from 8.2 billion baht in 2019."
25-ก.พ.-21,6:00,Property,Mo Chit Complex contract soon,"Legal wrangling lasted 25 years The Treasury Department is preparing to sign a contract for the Mo Chit Complex project worth 26 billion baht, after 25 years of delays, says director-general Yuttana Yimgarund. The 63-rai development project is located across Chatuchak Park and Bangkok Terminal is the concession recipient. The development plan is undergoing an environmental impact assessment, expected to be finalised over the next 2-3 months, with the Treasury Department signing a project contract with Bangkok Terminal afterward for construction to commence, said Mr Yuttana. The Mo Chit Complex project has been delayed for more than two decades after the department signed a contract with Sun Estate, which was later renamed Bangkok Terminal. In 2001, the Office of the Council of State ruled the project contract was illegal and the contract had non-binding terms. However, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled in 2013 the status of the contract had not been terminated and Bangkok Terminal and the Treasury Department would have to adhere to the contract. The department then proceeded with project development in line with the Public-Private Partnership Act of 2013. The Mo Chit Complex project has a total area of 888,000 square metres, with 112,000 sq m designated for transport and government use and 776,000 sq m allotted for commercial use by Bangkok Terminal. The complex has a 30-year concession period and construction will take five years to complete following the contract signing process. The concession stipulates the concessionaire is required to pay the department a land use fee of 550 million baht and rental fee during construction of 6.1 million baht per year, in addition to an annual 5-million-baht rental fee throughout the concession period after construction is completed."

Chief executive Anuphong Assavabhokhin said the condo market has been sluggish since last year, with a sharp contraction from the lack of foreign buyers, particularly Chinese, who were big spenders in Thailand. ""In the first half this year, condo market sentiment remains poor,"" he said. ""Developers with a large number of unsold condo supply will continue draining the stock. The market will resume in the second half."" While condo demand will likely shrink for the year, new supply scheduled to launch in 2021 faces difficulty in procuring project finance as banks become more careful about pre-finance, said Mr Anuphong. During Jan 1 to Feb 15, AP recorded 4.5 billion baht in presales, up 37% from the same period last year. The key driver was low-rise houses with a growth of 50% to 4.1 billion baht while condo presales stood at 400 million baht. Last year, AP's presales stood at 31.7 billion baht, below its target of 33.5 billion because of condo presales of only 3.82 billion, below its target of 11 billion. AP targets 35.5 billion baht in presales in 2021, up from 32.9 billion in 2019. Its presales peaked in 2018 with 41.3 billion baht. However, presales of low-rise houses outperformed its target of 22.5 billion baht, tallying 27.8 billion. This year AP plans to launch 30 new low-rise housing projects worth a combined 28.8 billion baht, comprising 14 single detached house projects worth 16.5 billion baht, 14 townhouse sites worth 10 billion, and two projects worth 2.3 billion in Chiang Rai and Ayutthaya. There are four condo projects -- two have a combined worth of 10 billion baht as joint ventures with Japanese developer Mitsubishi Estate. As of the end of 2020, it had a sales backlog of 37.9 billion baht. Of this amount, 12.5 billion baht was from low-rise houses that are scheduled to be realised this year. Another 25.5 billion baht is from condos booked from 2021-23. AP expects to have 43.1 billion baht in revenue this year, comprising 28 billion from low-rise houses, 14.1 billion from condos and 1 billion from non-residential business. Last year it recorded 46.1 billion baht in revenue, up from 32.5 billion in 2019 and exceeding its target of 41 billion baht. It was the company's highest revenue in its 30 years of operation, mainly attributed to the low-rise segment. With a strong financial status including a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.7 times as of the end of 2020, down from 1.09 in 2019, and 14 billion baht in cash, AP plans to spend 12 billion baht to buy new land plots this year, up from 4 billion in 2020."

President and chief executive Chanond Ruangkritya said urbanisation and living in a condo near a mass transit station would remain a trend despite the Covid-19 outbreak shifting consumer behaviour to low-rise houses. ""We don't know when the pandemic will end and whether it affects our belief in urbanisation and our business model focusing on condos,"" he said. ""Despite too much supply in the market, condos are not as poor as many think."" As of the end of 2020, the amount of unsold residential inventory in Bangkok and 26 major provinces totalled 319,527 units worth a combined 1 trillion baht, up from 301,098 units at the end of 2019, according to the Real Estate Information Center. Of the 2020 amount, 131,006 units were condos, up from 110,537 units, which will rise to 152,682 by the end of 2021. In Greater Bangkok, the unsold condo inventory stood at 100,055 units worth a combined 382.66 billion baht which will take 3.6 years to be absorbed, up from 2.3 years in the pre-pandemic period, Mr Chanond said. Without new projects launched last year, Ananda recorded 17.5 billion baht in presales which comprised 15.1 billion baht from condos, accounting for 86%, and 2.4 billion baht from low-rise houses. The 2020 presales were higher than the target of 16.8 billion baht but down from 26.65 billion baht in 2019. The five new condo projects will be located in Saphan Khwai, Sam Yan, Thong Lor, Sukhumvit Soi 38 and Lam Salee areas. It expected to have 18.57 billion baht in presales by the end of 2021. Ananda aimed to have residential transfers worth a total of 16 billion baht this year, down from 18.3 billion baht last year, which was lower than the target and that in 2019 of 20 billion baht each. As of the end of last year, the company had completed unsold units worth a combined 32.9 billion baht which comprised 24.3 billion baht from condos and 8.6 billion baht from low-rise houses. ""We will focus on selling ready-to-transfer units this year since 7.7 billion baht from the target transfer was backlog,"" according to Prasert Taedullayasatit, chief executive for property business."
17-ก.พ.-21,4:00,Property,NC Housing to launch 7 projects,"SET-listed developer NC Housing will continue launching low-rise housing with seven new projects worth a combined 5 billion baht in 2021 as the segment surpassed the sales target last year. Managing director Somnuek Tanthathoedtham said the pandemic saw consumer preferences move to low-rise houses from condos. The latter segment also accumulated too much supply over two consecutive years. ""The low-rise housing market saw a positive impact after hygiene and safety became a concern and social distancing was adopted,"" he said. As more than 90% of the company's portfolio was low-rise houses, presales last year exceeded a target of 2.7 billion baht set earlier in 2020. NC recorded 3.4 billion baht in presales, driven by low-rise houses. All of the seven new projects scheduled for launch this year will be low-rise houses, including townhouses, duplex houses and single detached houses priced at 2-5 million baht. Two of them, worth 1.5 billion baht, were postponed from last year, when the company launched only one project worth 1 billion baht. By the end of 2021, the company aims to have 3.4 billion baht in presales, the same amount to last year, and 2 billion baht in revenue, up 20% from 2020. Next month NC will announce a business plan for an intermediate care and wellness centre business to generate a recurring income in a long run. The wellness centre business was a joint venture with The Care And Health Group Limited Partnership for setting up Siri Arun Wellness in August 2019 with a registered capital of 25 million baht, where 60% is held by N.C. and the rest by the partner. The first branch opened early last year on Arun Amarin Road near Siriraj Hospital and the second and third were launched late 2020 -- one near the first one and another in Ubon Ratchathani."

Chief executive Nuttaphong Kunakornwong said the new plots will be used for low-rise housing developments, including single detached houses, duplex houses and townhouses in Greater Bangkok. ""Real demand in low-rise houses remains healthy, particularly among those with cash,"" he said. ""This sector will continue to be robust, even though the crisis is expected to last until next year."" He said despite there being demand in the condo market, a significant chunk of supply could still be left over. As a result, a slow absorption rate will continue for another few years if no new supply is added. By 2023-24, the sector will be able to come back as usual. Mr Nuttaphong said the company is ready to invest, being equipped with financial liquidity of 10 billion baht and its lowest debt to equity ratio at 1.38 times, down from 1.58 times at the end of 2019. This year it will launch 11 new projects worth a combined 17 billion baht, comprising eight low-rise housing projects worth 9 billion baht and three condo projects worth 8 billion baht. About 60-70% of the new projects are set to be launched in the second half of the year as the company expects a recovery in the market sentiment in that period. SC aims to have 19 billion baht in revenue by the end of 2020. The presales target is marked at 20 billion baht, up from a record high of 16.6 billion baht last year, which rose from 14.42 billion baht in 2019. A key driver in 2020 was sales from low-rise houses, which grew 37% to 14.75 billion baht, said Mr Nuttaphong. ""We aim to be the market leader for single detached houses priced from 10 million baht after shifting to units priced 10-20 million baht a few years ago,"" he added. This year the firm will launch a new brand for single detached houses, Venue ID, at Venue Rama 9 project. Unit prices are 5-10 million baht to accommodate Gen Y homebuyers. The design has a working space above the staircase. Three years ago the company found 10% of customers were searching for a large single detached house with fewer bedrooms as they were single. They preferred rooms for hobbies or other interests instead of extra bedrooms. In this quarter the new housing design, Baan Khon Sode (house for the single), was launched. Homes will have a pet door and customised designs in line with homebuyers' activities and interests."

Chaleerat Torcharat, vice-president of corporate marketing (CRM & partnership) at Sansiri, said the partnership with Bar-B-Q Plaza, a chain restaurant, whose dragon mascot Bar B Gon is well known and perceived as a friendly and joyful character will help the developer build brand awareness in the mass market segment. ""We are downshifting to units priced from 1 million baht,"" she said. ""Bar-B-Q Plaza will help us expand to the affordable market segment, particularly units priced 2-4 million baht."" Sansiri plans to launch a total of 24 new projects worth a combined 26 billion baht in 2021. Three-quarters will be affordably priced and four projects will be condos with units priced 1-2 million baht. The four projects will be located in Kaset-Nawamin, Ramkamhaeng, Ratchada and Bang Na. ""Our CRM strategy puts more focus to the customer experience from earlier living solutions,"" said Ms Chaleerat. ""The new focus includes food and delivery services."" The key campaign with Bar-B-Q Plaza, which will run from Feb 11 to Mar 31, will include a cash reward of 10,000-200,000 baht for Bar-B-Q Plaza members who refer their friends to purchase Sansiri units. Sansiri expects to have 1.5 billion baht in presales from the 49-day campaign, which will boost presales in the first quarter of 2021 to 5 billion baht. From Jan 1-Feb 9, the company recorded 3.5 billion baht in presales. In 2014, Sansiri partnered with Ralph Lauren to market the super luxury condo 98 Wireless, for record-high average prices per square metre of over 550,000 baht. Boonyanuch Boonbumrungsub, chief possible marketing officer at Food Passion (the owner of Bar-B-Q Plaza), said the partnership with Sansiri will help the company expand to a new customer base and boost sales in the first quarter.

9-ก.พ.-21,8:04,Property,Land prices to spike in H2,"REIC envisages good prospects for Bangkok landowners this year Land prices in Greater Bangkok are projected to rise at a rapid rate in the second half of 2021, in part because of the forecast of an economic recovery. Vichai Viratkapan, acting director-general of the Real Estate Information Center (REIC), said land prices in Greater Bangkok last year kept increasing, with a year-on-year rise of 17.1% in the price index of vacant land in the fourth quarter. The land price index escalated from 2019 before slowing down in the third quarter of 2020 to 0.7% growth quarter-on-quarter, he said. But the quarterly margin increased to 7.3% in the fourth quarter. ""New infections late last year mean the first half index will slightly increase,"" said Mr Vichai. ""But with an economic and property market recovery expected, a higher increase as in 2019 will likely be seen in the second half of this year,"" said Mr Vichai. According to REIC, a quarterly increase in the land price index in the fourth quarter of 2019 was the highest at 11%, following the highest jump in the second quarter of 2018 which was recorded at 15.2%. REIC noted that 2018 also saw the highest leap year-on-year for three consecutive quarters at 32.3%, 31.6% and 32.6% in the second, third and fourth quarters -- the largest since the centre started the survey in 2012. Mr Vichai said the change in land prices in Greater Bangkok was largely dominated by land prices in locations near mass transit lines which soared two to four times higher than the overall land price. Land prices in locations near the Blue Line from Bang Khae to Phutthamonthon Sai 4 topped the growth rate in the fourth quarter last year at 67.6% year-on-year and 33.7% quarter-on-quarter as this section was a future project.This location ranked third in the second and third quarters of 2020 and fourth in the first quarter of 2020, surpassing locations near the Green Line from Ku Kot to Lam Luk Ka and those near the Pink Line from Kae Rai to Min Buri. The Green Line from Ku Kot to Lam Luk Ka saw the largest increase in the land price index for three consecutive quarters from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2020 before losing to the Pink Line in the third quarter of last year. The spike in land prices in the area from Ku Kot to Lam Luk Ka dropped to only 10.4% in the fourth quarter last year after a jump of 61.3-66% earlier. The second biggest increase in the fourth quarter last year was the Light Red Line from Taling Chan to Sala Ya with a year-on-year increase of 43.3% and a quarter-on-quarter rise of 26.6%. It was the only location ranked in the top five for eight consecutive quarters since the first quarter of 2019. There were three new mass transit lines emerging in the top five of price index growth. One of them was the Gold Line in Thon Buri which started operating with only three stations in December last year. The other was the Orange Line from Taling Chan to the Cultural Centre which received a windfall from the 74.3% construction progress from the Cultural Centre to Min Buri as of December 2020, said Mr Vichai. The Blue Line from Hua Lamphong to Bang Khae was among the new rising locations, coming in fifth place with a 35.6% rise year-on-year and 16% quarter-on-quarter."
9-ก.พ.-21,7:33,Property,Home loan help for lower earners,"More than half of this year's new housing loan target of 215 billion baht will be provided with low interest rates to help low-income earners to purchase their own homes, says GH Bank. State-owned GH Bank plans to offer low-interest housing loans to low-income earners under the ""Social Solution"" project, said GH Bank president Chatchai Sirilai. ""The total credit line of the loan programme tallies 140 billion baht from the bank's target of total new housing loans valued at 215 billion baht,"" said Mr Chatchai. The first batch of low-interest housing loans has a total credit line of 70 billion baht. Interest rates applied for the first three years of loan repayment are capped at 3.05%, 2.75% and 4%, respectively. This loan batch is aimed at catering to three main client groups. The first group comprises civil servants and university staff. The second and third groups are classified as those whose monthly salaries do not exceed 25,000 baht and 35,000 baht, respectively. GH Bank is also offering low-interest loans to medical staff for their hard work during the Covid-19 outbreak. The bank yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding with the Medical Council of Thailand under the ""Life Begins with GHB"" project, which aims to assist 60,000 members of the Medical Council of Thailand to have their own homes. The project has a total credit line of 5 billion baht. The interest rate applied for the first year of the loan repayment is capped at 2.39% before rising to 2.59% for the second year. Housing loans offered by GH Bank stood at 225 billion baht in 2020, up 4.6% year-on-year and considered a record high since its inception in 1953 due to government support providing low-interest housing loans. GH Bank's total outstanding loans were registered at 1.3 trillion baht last year and net profit reached 10.5 billion baht, down 21.4% year-on-year. Non-performing loans were recorded at 47.6 billion baht, making up 3.6% of the bank's total outstanding loans."
8-ก.พ.-21,6:44,Property,Industrial estates set to expand,"Colliers projects growth at 5-10% in 2021 buoyed by state investment and stimulus Despite risks from the travel ban, a delay in vaccine distribution and new tensions in US-China trade, the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) and e-commerce are expected to continue spurring industrial property growth, in part thanks to stimulus plans and government investment in infrastructure and transport projects. Phattarachai Taweewong, director of research and communications at Colliers International Thailand, said the industrial estate business in 2021 should improve compared with last year. Land sales and leases this year will grow by 5-10% on average or 2,500-3,000 rai, driven by the government's investment, said Mr Phattarachai. ""With a development plan started in the EEC area, there will be several industrial estates being prepared for upgrade to a special promotion zone to support targeted industries in the EEC,"" he said. In addition to benefits offered from the Board of Investment (BoI), there are additional perks as an investment stimulus, such as higher tax incentives to attract investors and an amendment of regulations to facilitate business operations. Mr Phattarachai said demand to buy or rent industrial estates is in a recovery trend, driven by infrastructure improvements that can facilitate investment and logistics. The infrastructure projects include the Chachoengsao-Khlong 19-Kaeng Khoi railway, the Kaeng Khoi-Map Ta Phut and Pattaya-Map Ta Phut motorways, the U-tapao airport commercial development, the development of Laem Chabang Port phase 3, and the Bangkok-Rayong high-speed train. An expansion of industrial estate areas is in line with the direction of private investment, which will create a positive impact, he said. According to Colliers, land sales and leases in industrial estates in the second half last year decreased slightly by 1.52% to 2,150 rai from 2,183 rai in 2019. Most of the activity remained in the EEC area, with 1,840 rai accounting for 85% of total sales, a rise of 0.29% from the first half of 2020. Covid-19 did not have an impact on demand overall, as plummeting demand was largely from foreign investors unable to enter the country, said Colliers. The average occupancy rate of industrial estates stood at 76.2% in the second half of 2020, 0.04% higher than the first half. ""The new round of the pandemic late last year caused concerns among industrial estate developers. Many of them reduced or maintained their prices to retain customers,"" said Mr Phattarachai. Bangkok, as a hub of logistics, remained the location with the highest prices, followed by Samut Prakan and Pathum Thani. However, the EEC area stole the limelight with a significant increase in land prices, reported Colliers. In other areas, land prices remained relatively lower as the costs of vacant land were lower than those in Greater Bangkok and the EEC area that covers Chon Buri, Rayong and Chachoengsao. As a result, there was still a lot of land remaining for sale. According to the BoI, there were 1,098 promotional investment projects in 2020, a slight increase of 1% over 2019. Total investment value dropped 15% to 224 billion baht. Of this amount, 58% was in targeted industries led by electronics, followed by agriculture and food processing, automotive and parts, and medical. Colliers forecast this value to exceed 300 billion baht in 2021, accelerated by smart electronics, medical and food industries. Foreign direct investment in the first nine months of 2020 totalled 657 projects worth a combined 119 billion baht, with Japan topping the chart with 139 projects worth 37.5 billion baht, followed by China with 129 projects worth 21.2 billion and the Netherlands with 62 projects worth 17.5 billion. The EEC is seen as a magnet, attracting 313 projects worth 109 billion baht. The sum comprises 165 projects worth 46.9 billion baht in Chon Buri, 112 projects worth 48.4 billion in Rayong, and 36 projects worth 14.2 billion in Chachoengsao. Chachoengsao saw the highest growth from 2019 at 4% as it is closer to Bangkok, said Colliers. ""We were approached by a lot of foreign investors who were interested in industrial estates. They were seeking warehouses and factories,"" said Mr Phattarachai. ""Most of them were Chinese, Japanese, European and American."" However, key risks include the new wave of the pandemic prolonging travel bans, a delay in vaccination rollouts, new tension in US-China trade and a strong baht, he said. Adam Bell, head of industrial and logistics at CBRE Thailand, said the logistics market proved to be one of the least-affected industries during the pandemic as more Thai consumers relied on e-commerce and the digital economy, leading to demand for modern logistics properties (MLP) in Thailand. Over 400,000 square metres of new MLP supply will come into the market in 2021, the vast majority of which will be in the built-to-suit format, he said. For supply chains, many China-based manufacturers continued to consider relocating their production bases to Southeast Asia, where the costs are lower. Investors have become increasingly interested in buying factories to have more control over their premises, while many developers slowed the speculative development of ready-built factories, said Mr Bell. According to Colliers, warehouse and factory demand will keep growing this year, even as some businesses are affected by the outbreak. New supply of 500,000 sq m set to be introduced this year will mostly come from large players, said Colliers. Around 300,000 sq m is in the EEC area, which will be served by the infrastructure projects. Some industrial estate developers are expanding warehouses and factories on more than 150 rai for a rental space of up to 150,000 sq m on Bang Na-Trat and Theparak roads to support rising demand over the next two years. At the end of 2020, the largest supply remained in Samut Prakan with 2.69 million sq m or 38% of the total, followed by the EEC area with 2.25 million sq m or 32%. Nationwide, there is 6.96 million sq m of warehouse and factory supply. Of the amount, around 6 million sq m is occupied, accounting for 87.5%, up 0.2 percentage points from the first half of 2020. Samut Prakan recorded the highest occupancy at 91% as the province is linked to manufacturing and logistics hubs, followed by Bangkok at 90.7%. The EEC area had 78.2%, with rising demand attributed to electronics and pharmaceutical industries. Despite the pandemic, demand for warehouses and factories remained strong, with around 100,000 sq m signed via deals during the second half of 2020. There are many more contracts from e-commerce, food and logistics industries, which benefited from the work-from-home trend, said Colliers. Last year online shopping in Thailand reached 220 billion baht, accounting for 4-5% of the total retail business and representing 35% growth over 2019. Average rent remained unchanged at 152 baht per sq m. The highest was in Bangkok at 174 baht, with some areas asking for 200 baht per sq m, followed by the EEC and Samut Prakan at 153 and 152 baht, respectively. Teerawit Limthongsakul, managing director of Nexus Real Estate Advisory Co, said foreign investors in the industrial sector continue to consider Thailand a preferred choice. ""The pandemic was controlled fairly well, while infrastructure and EEC development plans are underway,"" he said. Even though the global recession and regional political issues created some difficulties in decision-making for investors, industrial estate developers still saw opportunities from positive factors and plan to expand their businesses for 3-5 years, said Mr Teerawit. Around 10% of the existing supply or 20,000 rai in industrial parks should support the opening of high-speed train projects in 2024, he said. The inventory of serviced land plots stood at almost 200,000 rai with a sales rate of over 90%, while the average land price was 6.1 million baht per rai, up 1.7%. The pandemic is a catalyst for e-commerce business growth. According to SCB's Economic Intelligence Center, e-commerce sales this year will grow 35%, driving total parcel shipments to over 4 million items per day. This will lead to growth in ready-built warehouses, which have an occupancy rate of 90%, accounting for 3.89 million sq m, said Mr Teerawit. ""The industrial market will see a new trend in absorbing new development pipelines,"" he said. ""Technology has become a big part of our life and the coronavirus means working from home and video conferencing are more accepted."" This disruption led millions to use many cloud services. Rising demand requires a bigger data centre to support and collect data, said Mr Teerawit."
